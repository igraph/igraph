/**
 * \define IGRAPH_THREAD_SAFE
 *
 * Specifies whether igraph was built in thread-safe mode.
 *
 * This macro is defined to 1 if the current build of the igraph library is
 * built in thread-safe mode, and 0 if it is not. A thread-safe igraph library
 * attempts to use thread-local data structures instead of global ones, but
 * note that this is not (and can not) be guaranteed for third-party libraries
 * that igraph links to.
