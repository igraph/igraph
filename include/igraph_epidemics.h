 * \struct igraph_sir_t
 * \brief The result of one SIR model simulation.
 *
 * Data structure to store the results of one simulation
 * of the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model on a graph.
 *
 * It has the following members. They are all (real or integer)
 * vectors, and they are of the same length.
 *
 * \member times A vector, the times of the events are stored here.
 * \member no_s An integer vector, the number of susceptibles in
 *              each time step is stored here.
 * \member no_i An integer vector, the number of infected individuals
 *              at each time step, is stored here.
 * \member no_r An integer vector, the number of recovered individuals
 *              is stored here at each time step.
