/**
 * \section about_status_handlers Status reporting
 *
 * <para>
 * In addition to the possibility of reporting the progress of an
 * igraph computation via \ref igraph_progress(), it is also possible
 * to report simple status messages from within igraph functions,
 * without having to judge how much of the computation was performed
 * already. For this one needs to install a status handler function.
 * </para>
 *
 * <para>
 * Status handler functions must be of type \ref igraph_status_handler_t
 * and they can be install by a call to \ref igraph_set_status_handler().
 * Currently there is a simple predefined status handler function,
 * called \ref igraph_status_handler_stderr(), but the user can define
 * new ones.
 * </para>
 *
 * <para>
 * Igraph functions report their status via a call to the
 * \ref IGRAPH_STATUS() or the \ref IGRAPH_STATUSF() macro.
 * </para>
