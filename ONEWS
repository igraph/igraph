igraph 0.6
==========

Released June 11, 2012

See also the release notes at 
http://igraph.sf.net/relnotes-0.6.html

R: Major new features
---------------------

- Vertices and edges are numbered from 1 instead of 0. 
  Note that this makes most of the old R igraph code incompatible
  with igraph 0.6. If you want to use your old code, please use 
  the igraph0 package. See more at http://igraph.sf.net/relnotes-0.6.html.
- The '\[' and '\[\[' operators can now be used on igraph graphs, 
  for '\[' the graph behaves as an adjacency matrix, for '[[' is 
  is treated as an adjacency list. It is also much simpler to
  manipulate the graph structure, i.e. add/remove edges and vertices, 
  with some new operators. See more at ?graph.structure.
- In all functions that take a vector or list of vertices or edges, 
  vertex/edge names can be given instead of the numeric ids.
- New package 'igraphdata', contains a number of data sets that can
  be used directly in igraph.
- Igraph now supports loading graphs from the Nexus online data
  repository, see nexus.get(), nexus.info(), nexus.list() and 
  nexus.search().
- All the community structure finding algorithm return a 'communities'
  object now, which has a bunch of useful operations, see 
  ?communities for details.
- Vertex and edge attributes are handled much better now. They 
  are kept whenever possible, and can be combined via a flexible API.
  See ?attribute.combination.
- R now prints igraph graphs to the screen in a more structured and 
  informative way. The output of summary() was also updated
  accordingly.

R: Other new features
---------------------

- It is possible to mark vertex groups on plots, via
  shading. Communities and cohesive blocks are plotted using this by
  default.
- Some igraph demos are now available, see a list via 
  'demo(package="igraph")'.
- igraph now tries to select the optimal layout algorithm, when
  plotting a graph.
- Added a simple console, using Tcl/Tk. It contains a text area
  for status messages and also a status bar. See igraph.console().
- Reimplemented igraph options support, see igraph.options() and 
  getIgraphOpt().
- Igraph functions can now print status messages.

R: New or updated functions
---------------------------

Community detection
-------------------
- The multi-level modularity optimization community structure detection 
  algorithm by Blondel et al. was added, see multilevel.community().

  optimal.community().

  from Aaron Clauset. See hrg.game(), hrg.fit(), etc.

  Navarro for the code. See infomap.community().

  edge weights now.

  this is required for some lattice-like graphs to avoid overflow.

igraph 0.5.1
============

Released July 14, 2008

See also the release notes at 
http://igraph.sf.net/relnotes-0.5.1.html

New in the R interface
----------------------

- A new layout generator called DrL.
- Uniform sampling of random connected undirected graphs with a 
  given degree sequence.
- Edge labels are plotted at 1/3 of the edge, this is better if 
  the graph has mutual edges.
- Initial and experimental vertex shape support in 'plot'.
- New function, 'graph.adjlist' creates igraph graphs from
  adjacency lists.
- Conversion to/from graphNEL graphs, from the 'graph' R package.
- Fastgreedy community detection can utilize edge weights now, this 
  was missing from the R interface.
- The 'arrow.width' graphical parameter was added.
- graph.data.frame has a new argument 'vertices'.
- graph.adjacency and get.adjacency support sparse matrices, 
  the 'Matrix' package is required to use this functionality.
- graph.adjacency adds column/row names as 'name' attribute.
- Weighted shortest paths using Dijkstra's or the Belmann-Ford 
  algorithm.
- Shortest path functions return 'Inf' for unreachable vertices.
- New function 'is.mutual' to find mutual edges in a directed graph.
- Added inverse log-weighted similarity measure (a.k.a. Adamic/Adar
  similarity).
- preference.game and asymmetric.preference.game were 
  rewritten, they are O(|V|+|E|) now, instead of O(|V|^2).
- Edge weight support in function 'get.shortest.paths', it uses 
  Dijkstra's algorithm.

Bugs corrected in the R interface
---------------------------------
  
- A bug was corrected in write.pajek.bgraph.
- Several bugs were corrected in graph.adjacency.
- Pajek reader bug corrected, used to segfault if '\*Vertices' 
  was missing.

  undirected graph. (Which does not make sense anyway.)

  edge crossings.

  attribute was not specified.
- Fixed a bug in the graph isomorphism routine for small (3-4 vertices)
  graphs.

  are expected to call this internally) now checks whether the number
  of vertices is finite.

- attribute handling bug when deleting edges corrected
- GraphML escaping and NaN handling corrected
- bug corrected to make it possible compile the R package without the 
  libxml2 library
- a bug in Erdos-Renyi graph generation corrected: it had problems 
  with generating large directed graphs
- bug in constraint calculation corrected, it works well now
- fixed memory leaks in igraph_read_graph_graphml
- error handling bug corrected in igraph_read_graph_graphml
- bug corrected in R version of graph.laplacian when normalized
  Laplacian is requested
- memory leak corrected in get.all.shortest.paths in the R package

igraph 0.2.1
=========

Released Aug 23, 2006

This is a bug-fix release. Bugs fixed:
- igraph_reciprocity (reciprocity in R) corrected to avoid segfaults
- some docs updates
- various R package updated to make it conform to the CRAN rules

igraph 0.2
=========

Released Aug 18, 2006

Release time at last! There are many new things in igraph 0.2, the
most important ones:
- reading writing Pajek and GraphML formats with attributes
  (not all Pajek and GraphML files are supported, see documentation
  for details)
- iterators totally rewritten, it is much faster and cleaner now
- the RANDEDU fast motif search algorithm is implemented
- many new graph generators, both games and regular graphs
- many new structural properties: transitivity, reciprocity, etc.
- graph operators: union, intersection, difference, structural holes, etc.
- conversion between directed and undirected graphs
- new layout algorithms for trees and large graphs, 3D layouts

and many more.

New things in the R package:
- support for CTRL+C
- new functions: Graph Laplacian, Burt's constraint, etc.
- vertex/edge sequences totally rewritten, smart indexing (see manual)
- new R manual and tutorial: 'Network Analysis with igraph', still 
  under development but useful
- very basic 3D plotting using OpenGL

Although this release was somewhat tested on Linux, MS Windows, Mac
OSX, Solaris 8 and FreeBSD, no heavy testing was done, so it might
contain bugs, and we kindly ask you to send bug reports to make igraph
better.

igraph mailing lists
====================

Aug 18, 2006

I've set up two igraph mailing lists: igraph-help for
general igraph questions and discussion and
igraph-anonunce for announcements. See 
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-help and
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-announce
for subscription information, archives, etc.

igraph 0.1
=========

Released Jan 30, 2006

After about a year of development this is the first "official" release 
of the igraph library. This release should be considered as beta 
software, but it should be useful in general. Please send your 
questions and comments.
