# igraph C library changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

 - `igraph_reverse_edges()` reverses the specified edges in the graph while preserving all attributes.

### Fixed

 - Fixed incorrect results from `igraph_local_scan_1_ecount()` when the graph was directed but the mode was `IGRAPH_ALL` and some nodes had loop edges. See issue #2092.
 - In some rare edge cases, `igraph_pagerank()` with the ARPACK method and `igraph_hub_score()` / `igraph_authority_score()` could return incorrect results. The problem could be detected by checking that the returned eigenvalue is not negative. See issue #2090.
 - `igraph_permute_vertices()` now checks for out-of-range indices in the permutation vector.
 - `igraph_create()` now checks for non-finite vertex indices in the edges vector.
 - `igraph_eigenvector_centrality()` would return incorrect scores when some weights were negative.
 - `igraph_es_seq()` and `igraph_ess_seq()` did not include the `to` vertex in the sequence.
 - `igraph_eit_create()` and `igraph_vit_create()` now checks that all edge/vertex indices are in range when creating iterators from sequence-type selectors.

### Other

 - Documentation improvement.

## [0.9.9] - 2022-06-04

### Changed

 - `igraph_community_walktrap()` now uses double precision floating point operations internally instead of single precision.
 - In `igraph_community_leiden()`, the `nb_clusters` output parameter is now optional (i.e. it can be `NULL`).
 - `igraph_read_graph_graphml()` no longer attempts to temporarily set the C locale, and will therefore not work correctly if the current locale uses a decimal comma.

### Fixed

 - `igraph_community_walktrap()` would return an invalid `modularity` vector when the `merges` matrix was not requested.
 - `igraph_community_walktrap()` would return a `modularity` vector that was too long for disconnected graphs. This would cause a failure in some weighted graphs when the `membership` vector was requested.
 - `igraph_community_walktrap()` now checks the weight vector: only non-negative weights are accepted, and all vertices must have non-zero strength.
 - `igraph_community_walktrap()` now returns a modularity score of NaN for graphs with no edges.
 - `igraph_community_fast_greedy()` now returns a modularity score of NaN for graphs with no edges.
 - `igraph_community_edge_betweenness()` now returns a modularity vector with a single NaN entry for graph with no edges. Previously it returned a zero-length vector.
 - `igraph_community_leading_eigenvector()` does not ignore non-ARPACK-related errors from `igraph_arpack_rssolve()` any more.
 - `igraph_preference_game()` now works correctly when `fixed_size` is true and
   `type_dist` is not given; earlier versions had a bug where more than half of
   the vertices mistakenly ended up in group 0.
 - Fixed a memory leak in `igraph_hrg_fit()` when using `start=1`.
 - `igraph_write_graph_dot()` now outputs NaN values unchanged.
 - `igraph_write_graph_dot()` no longer produces invalid DOT files when empty string attributes are present.
 - `igraph_layout_fruchterman_reingold()` and `igraph_layout_kamada_kawai()`, as well as their 3D versions, did not respect vertex coordinate bounds (`xmin`, `xmax`, etc.) when minimum values were large or maximum values were small. This is now fixed.
 - The initial coordinates of the Kamada-Kawai layout (`igraph_layout_kamada_kawai()` and `igraph_layout_kamada_kawai_3d()`) are chosen to be more in line with the original publication, improving the stability of the result. See isse #963. This changes the output of the function for the same graph, compared with previous versions. To obtain the same layout, initialize coordinates with `igraph_layout_circle()` (in 2D) or `igraph_layout_sphere()` (in 3D).
 - Improved numerical stability in Kamada-Kawai layout.
 - Corrected a problem in the calculation of displacements in `igraph_layout_fruchterman_reingold()` and its 3D version. This fixes using the "grid" variant of the algorithm on disconnected graphs.
 - `igraph_sumtree_search()` would consider search intervals open on the left and closed on the right, contrary to the documentation. This is now corrected to closed on the left and open on the right. In some cases this lead to a zero-weight element being returned for a zero search value. See issue #2080.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.

## [0.9.8] - 2022-04-08

### Fixed

 - Assertion failure in `igraph_bfs()` when an empty `roots` or `restricted` vector was provided.
 - `igraph_diversity()` now returns 0 for degree-1 vertices. Previously it incorrectly returned NaN or +-Inf depending on roundoff errors.
 - `igraph_community_walktrap()` does not crash any more when provided with
   `modularity=NULL` and `membership=NULL`.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.

## [0.9.7] - 2022-03-16

### Changed

 - `igraph_get_all_shortest_paths_dijsktra()` now uses tolerances when comparing path
   lengths, and is thus robust to numerical roundoff errors.
 - `igraph_vector_*_swap` and `igraph_matrix_swap` now take O(1) instead of O(n) and accept all sizes.

### Fixed

 - NCOL and LGL format writers no longer accept "name" and "weight" attributes
   of invalid types.
 - The LGL writer could not access numerical weight attributes, potentially leading
   to crashes.
 - External PLFIT libraries and their headers are now detected at their standard
   installation location.
 - `igraph_vector_init()` no longer accepts negative vector sizes.
 - `igraph_assortativity_nominal()` crashed on the null graph.
 - Label propagation now ensures that all labels are dominant.
 - Fixed incorrect partition results for walktrap algorithm (issue #1927)
 - Negative values returned by `igraph_rng_get_integer()` and `RNG_INTEGER()` were incorrect,
   one larger than they should have been.
 - `igraph_community_walktrap()` now checks its `steps` input argument.
 - The first modularity value reported by `igraph_community_walktrap()` was
   incorrect (it was always zero). This is now fixed.
 - `igraph_correlated_game()` would return incorrect results, or exhaust the memory,
    for most input graphs that were not generated with `igraph_erdos_renyi_game_gnp()`.

### Other

 - The C attribute handler now verifies attribute types when retrieving attributes.
 - Documentation improvements.

## [0.9.6] - 2022-01-05

### Changed

 - Isomorphism class functions (`igraph_isoclass()`, `igraph_isoclass_subgraph()`,
   `igraph_isoclass_create`) and motif finder functions (`igraph_motifs_randesu()`,
   `igraph_motifs_randesu_estimate()`, `igraph_motifs_randesu_callback()`) now
   support undirected (sub)graphs of sizes 5 and 6. Previsouly only sizes 3 and 4
   were supported.

### Fixed

 - igraph would not build with MinGW when using the vendored GLPK and enabling TLS.
 - Removed some uses of `abort()` from vendored libraries, which could unexpectedly
   shut down the host language of igraph's high-level interfaces.
 - `igraph_community_label_propagation()` no longer leaves any vertices unlabeled
   when they were not reachable from any labeled ones, i.e. the returned membership
   vector is guaranteed not to contain negative values (#1853).
 - The Kamada-Kawai layout is now interruptible.
 - The Fruchterman-Reingold layout is now interruptible.
 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_cmp_epsilon()` that resulted in incorrect results for
   edge betweenness calculations in certain rare cases with x87 floating point
   math when LTO was also enabled (#1894).
 - Weighted clique related functions now fall back to the unweighted variants
   when a null vertex weight vector is given to them.
 - `igraph_erdos_renyi_game_(gnm|gnp)` would not produce self-loops for the singleton
   graph.
 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_local_efficiency()` that sometimes erroneously
   reported zero as the local efficiency of a vertex in directed graphs.
 - `igraph_vector_update()` (and its type-specific variants) did not check for
   memory allocation failure.
 - Fixed a potential crash in the GraphML reader that would be triggered by some
   invalid GraphML files.

### Other

 - `igraph_is_tree()` has improved performance and memory usage.
 - `igraph_is_connected()` has improved performance when checking weak connectedness.
 - Improved error handling in `igraph_maximal_cliques()` and related functions.
 - The build system now checks that GLPK is of a compatible version (4.57 or later).
 - The vendored `plfit` package was updated to 0.9.3.
 - You can now build igraph with an external `plfit` instead of the vendored one.
 - Documentation improvements.

## [0.9.5] - 2021-11-11

### Fixed

 - `igraph_reindex_membership()` does not allow negative membership indices any more.

 - `igraph_rewire_directed_edges()` now generates multigraphs when edge directions
   are ignored, to make it consistent with the directed case.

 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_gomory_hu_tree()` that returned only the equivalent flow
   tree instead of the cut tree (#1810).

 - Fixed a bug in the `IGRAPH_TO_UNDIRECTED_COLLAPSE` mode of
   `igraph_to_undirected()` that provided an incorrect merge vector to the
   attribute handler, leading to problems when edge attributes were merged
   using an attribute combination (#1814).

 - Fixed the behaviour of the `IGRAPH_ENABLE_LTO` option when it was set to
   `AUTO`; earlier versions had a bug where `AUTO` simply checked whether LTO
   is supported but then did not use LTO even if it was supported.

 - When using igraph from a CMake project, it is now checked that the project has
   the C++ language enabled. This is necessary for linking to igraph with CMake.

### Other

 - Improved the root selection method for disconnected graphs in the
   Reingold-Tilford layout (#1836). The new root selection method provides
   niceer results if the graph is not a tree, although it is still recommended
   to use the Sugiyama layout instead, unless the input graph is _almost_ a
   tree, in which case Reingold-Tilfold may still be preferred.

 - `igraph_decompose()` is now much faster for large graphs containing many
   isolates or small components (#960).

 - `igraph_largest_cliques()` and `igraph_clique_number()` were re-written to
   use `igraph_maximal_cliques_callback()` so they are much faster now (#804).

 - The vendored GLPK has been upgraded to GLPK 5.0.

 - Documentation improvements.

## [0.9.4] - 2021-05-31

### Changed

 - Unweighted transitivity (i.e. clustering coefficient) calculations now ignore multi-edges and edge directions instead of rejecting multigraphs and directed graphs.
 - `igraph_transitivity_barrat()` now returns an error code if the input graph has multiple edges (which is not handled correctly by the implementation yet).

### Fixed

 - `igraph_local_scan_k_ecount()` now handles loops correctly.
 - `igraph_transitivity_avglocal_undirected()` is no longer slower than `igraph_transitivity_local_undirected()`.
 - Worked around an invalid warning issued by Clang 9.0 when compiling with OpenMP.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.

## [0.9.3] - 2021-05-05

### Added

 - OpenMP is now enabled and used by certain functions (notably PageRank calculation) when the compiler supports it. Set `IGRAPH_OPENMP_SUPPORT=OFF` at configuration time to disable this.

### Fixed

 - `igraph_get_incidence()` no longer reads and writes out of bounds when given a non-bipartite graph, but gives a warning and ignores edges within a part.
 - `igraph_dyad_census()` no longer reports an overflow on singleton graphs, and handles loops and multigraphs correctly. Undirected graphs are handled consistently and will no longer give a warning.
 - `igraph_vector_lex_cmp()` and `igraph_vector_colex_cmp()` dereferenced their arguments only once instead of twice, and therefore did not work with `igraph_vector_ptr_sort()`.
 - `igraph_maximal_cliques_subset()` and `igraph_transitivity_barrat()` corrupted the error handling stack ("finally stack") under some circumstances.
 - CMake package files did not respect `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`. This only affected Linux distributions which install into `lib64` or other locations instead of `lib`.
 - The parser sources could not be generated when igraph was in a location that contained spaces in its path.
 - igraph no longer links to the math library (`libm`) when this is not necessary.
 - `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` is now defined during compilation to enable compatibility with UWP.
 - Fixed a compilation issue on MSYS / MinGW when link-time optimization was enabled and the `MSYS Makefiles` CMake generator was used. Some source files in igraph were renamed as a consequence, but these should not affect users of the library.

### Deprecated

 - `igraph_rng_min()` is now deprecated; assume a constant zero as its return value if you used this function in your own code.

### Other

 - Updated the vendored CXSparse library to version 3.2.0

## [0.9.2] - 2021-04-14

### Added

 - CMake package files are now installed with igraph. This allows `find_package(igraph)` to find igraph and detect the appropriate compilation options for projects that link to it.

### Fixed

 - igraph can now be used as a CMake subproject in other CMake-based projects.
 - The documentaton can now be built from the release tarball.
 - Configuration will no longer fail when the release tarball is extracted into a subdirectory of an unrelated git repository.
 - The generated pkg-config file was incorrect when `CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>` variables were absolute paths.
 - On Unix-like systems, the library name is now `libigraph.so.0.0.0`, as it used to be for igraph 0.8 and earlier.
 - Fixed a return type mismatch in parser sources, and fixed some warnings with recent versions of gcc.
 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_get_shortest_paths_dijkstra()` and `igraph_get_shortest_paths_bellman_ford()` that returned incorrect results for unreachable vertices.

### Other

 - Improved installation instructions and tutorial.

## [0.9.1] - 2021-03-23

### Added

 - `igraph_vector_lex_cmp()` and `igraph_vector_colex_cmp()` for lexicographic
   and colexicographic comparison of vectors. These functions may also be used
   for sorting.

### Changed

 - `igraph_community_multilevel()` is now randomized (PR #1696, thanks to Daniel Noom).

### Fixed

 - CMake settings that controlled the library installation directory name, such as `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, were not respected.
 - Under some conditions, the generated pkg-config file contained an incorrect include directory path.
 - The following functions were not exported from the shared library: `igraph_subcomponent()`, `igraph_stack_ptr_free_all()`, `igraph_stack_ptr_destroy_all()`, `igraph_status_handler_stderr()`, `igraph_progress_handler_stderr()`.
 - Built-in random number generators (`igraph_rngtype_mt19937`, `igraph_rngtype_rand`, `igraph_rngtype_glibc2`) were not exported from the shared library.
 - `igraph_layout_graphopt()` no longer rounds the `spring_length` parameter to an integer.
 - `igraph_get_all_shortest_paths_dijkstra()` no longer modifies the `res` vector's item destructor.
 - `igraph_get_shortest_path_bellman_ford()` did not work correctly when calculating paths to all vertices.
 - `igraph_arpack_rnsolve()` checks its parameters more carefully.
 - `igraph_community_to_membership()` does not crash anymore when `csize` is requested but `membership` is not.
 - `igraph_citing_cited_type_game()`: fixed memory leaks (PR #1700, thanks to Daniel Noom).
 - `igraph_transitivity_undirected()`, `igraph_transitivity_avglocal_undirected()` and `igraph_transitivity_barrat()` no longer trigger an assertion failure when used with the null graph (PRs #1709, #1710).
 - `igraph_(personalized_)pagerank()` would return incorrect results for weighted multigraphs with fewer than 128 vertices when using `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_PRPACK`.
 - `igraph_diversity()` now checks its input more carefully, and throws an error when the input graph has multi-edges or is directed.
 - `igraph_shortest_paths_johnson()` would return incorrect results when the `to` argument differed from `from` (thanks to Daniel Noom).
 - `igraph_is_graphical()` would fail to set the result variable for certain special degree sequences in the undirected simple graph case.
 - Non-maximal clique finding functions would sometimes return incomplete results when finding more than 2147483647 (i.e. 2^31 - 1) cliques.
 - GLPK internal errors no longer crash igraph.
 - Fixed some potential memory leaks that could happen on error conditions or when certain functions were interrupted.
 - When testing a DLL build on Windows, the `PATH` was sometimes not set correctly, causing the tests to fail (PR #1692).
 - When compiling from the git repository (as opposed to the release tarball), the build would fail with recent versions of `bison` and `flex`.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.
 - Much faster documentation builds.
 - Allow using a pre-generated `arith.h` header for f2c when cross-compiling; see the Installation section of the documentation.
 - The `IGRAPH_ENABLE_LTO` build option now supports the `AUTO` value, which uses LTO only if the compiler supports it. Warning: CMake may not always be able to detect that LTO is not fully supported. Therefore, the default setting is `OFF`.
 - The following functions are now interruptible: `igraph_grg_game()`, `igraph_sbm_game()`, `igraph_barabasi_game()`, `igraph_barabasi_aging_game()`.
 - Functions that use GLPK, such as `igraph_feedback_arc_set()` and `igraph_community_optimal_modularity()` are now interruptible.
 - Add support for older versions of Clang that do not recognize the `-Wno-varargs` flag.

### Acknowledgments

 - Big thanks to Daniel Noom for continuing to expand the test suite and discovering and fixing several bugs in the process!

## [0.9.0] - 2021-02-16

### Added

 - Eulerian paths/cycles (PR #1346):
   * `igraph_is_eulerian()` finds out whether an Eulerian path/cycle exists.
   * `igraph_eulerian_path()` returns an Eulerian path.
   * `igraph_eulerian_cycle()` returns an Eulerian cycle.
 - Efficiency (PR #1344):
   * `igraph_global_efficiency()` computes the global efficiency of a network.
   * `igraph_local_efficiency()` computes the local efficiency around each vertex.
   * `igraph_average_local_efficiency()` computes the mean local efficiency.
 - Degree sequences (PR #1445):
   * `igraph_is_graphical()` checks if a degree sequence has a realization as a simple or multigraph, with or without self-loops.
   * `igraph_is_bigraphical()` checks if two degree sequences have a realization as a bipartite graph.
   * `igraph_realize_degree_sequence()` now supports constructing non-simple graphs as well.
 - There is a new fatal error handling mechanism (PR #1548):
   * `igraph_set_fatal_handler()` sets the fatal error handler. It is the only function in this functionality group that is relevant to end users.
   * The macro `IGRAPH_FATAL()` and the functions `igraph_fatal()` and `igraph_fatalf()` raise a fatal error. These are for internal use.
   * `IGRAPH_ASSERT()` is a replacement for the `assert()` macro. It is for internal use.
   * `igraph_fatal_handler_abort()` is the default fatal error handler.
 - The new `IGRAPH_WARNINGF`, `IGRAPH_ERRORF` and `IGRAPH_FATALF` macros provide warning/error reporting with `printf`-like syntax. (PR #1627, thanks to Daniel Noom!)
 - `igraph_average_path_length_dijkstra()` computes the mean shortest path length in weighted graphs (PR #1344).
 - `igraph_get_shortest_paths_bellman_ford()` computes the shortest paths (including the vertex and edge IDs along the paths) using the Bellman-Ford algorithm (PR #1642, thanks to Guy Rozenberg). This makes it possible to calculate the shortest paths on graphs with negative edge weights, which was not possible before with Dijkstra's algorithm.
 - `igraph_get_shortest_path_bellman_ford()` is a wrapper for `igraph_get_shortest_paths_bellman_ford()` for the single path case.
 - `igraph_is_same_graph()` cheks that two labelled graphs are the same (PR #1604).
 - Harmonic centrality (PR #1583):
   * `igraph_harmonic_centrality()` computes the harmonic centrality of vertices.
   * `igraph_harmonic_centrality_cutoff()` computes the range-limited harmonic centrality.
 - Range-limited centralities, currently equivalent to the old functions with names ending in `_estimate` (PR #1583):
   * `igraph_closeness_cutoff()`.
   * `igraph_betweenness_cutoff()`.
   * `igraph_edge_betweenness_cutoff()`.
 - `igraph_vector_is_any_nan()` checks if any elements of an `igraph_vector_t` is NaN.
 - `igraph_inclist_size()` returns the number of vertices in an incidence list.
 - `igraph_lazy_adjlist_size()` returns the number of vertices in a lazy adjacency list.
 - `igraph_lazy_inclist_size()` returns the number of vertices in a lazy incidence list.
 - `igraph_bfs_simple()` now provides a simpler interface to the breadth-first search functionality.

### Changed

 - igraph now uses a CMake-based build sysyem.
 - GMP support can no longer be disabled. When GMP is not present on the system, igraph will use an embedded copy of Mini-GMP (PR #1549).
 - Bliss has been updated to version 0.75. Bliss functions are now interruptible. Thanks to Tommi Junttila for making this possible!
 - Adjacency and incidence lists:
   * `igraph_adjlist_init()` and `igraph_lazy_adjlist_init()` now require the caller to specify what to do with loop and multiple edges.
   * `igraph_inclist_init()` and `igraph_lazy_inclist_init()` now require the caller to specify what to do with loop edges.
   * Adjacency and incidence lists now use `igraph_vector_int_t` consistently.
 - Community detection:
   * `igraph_community_multilevel()`: added resolution parameter.
   * `igraph_community_fluid_communities()`: graphs with no vertices or with one vertex only are now supported; they return a trivial partition.
 - Modularity:
   * `igraph_modularity()` and `igraph_modularity_matrix()`: added resolution parameter.
   * `igraph_modularity()` and `igraph_modularity_matrix()` now support the directed version of modularity.
   * `igraph_modularity()` returns NaN for graphs with no edges to indicate that the modularity is not well-defined for such graphs.
 - Centralities:
   * `cutoff=0` is no longer interpreted as infinity (i.e. no cutoff) in `betweenness`, `edge_betweenness` and `closeness`. If no cutoff is desired, use a negative value such as `cutoff=-1`.
   * The `nobigint` argument has been removed from `igraph_betweenness()`, `igraph_betweenness_estimate()` and `igraph_centralization_betweenness()`, as it is not longer needed. The current implementation is more accurate than the old one using big integers.
   * `igraph_closeness()` now considers only reachable vertices during the calculation (i.e. the closeness is calculated per-component in the undirected case) (PR #1630).
   * `igraph_closeness()` gained two additional output parameters, `reachable_count` and `all_reachable`, returning the number of reached vertices from each vertex, as well as whether all vertices were reachable. This allows for computing various generalizations of closeness for disconnected graphs (PR #1630).
   * `igraph_pagerank()`, `igraph_personalized_pagerank()` and `igraph_personalized_pagerank_vs()` no longer support the `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_POWER` method. Their `options` argument now has type `igraph_arpack_options_t *` instead of `void *`.
 - Shortest paths (PR #1344):
   * `igraph_average_path_length()` now returns the number of disconnected vertex pairs in the new `unconn_pairs` output argument.
   * `igraph_diameter()` now return the result as an `igraph_real_t` instead of an `igraph_integer_t`.
   * `igraph_average_path_length()`  and `igraph_diameter()` now return `IGRAPH_INFINITY` when `unconn=FALSE` and the graph is not connected. Previously they returned the number of vertices.
 - Trait-based random graph generators:
   * `igraph_callaway_traits_game()` and `igraph_establishment_game()` now have an optional output argument to retrieve the generated vertex types.
   * `igraph_callaway_traits_game()` and `igraph_establishment_game()` now allow omitting the type distribution vector, in which case they assume a uniform distribution.
   * `igraph_asymmetric_preference_game()` now accept a different number of in-types and out-types.
 - `igraph_subisomorphic_lad()` now supports graphs with self-loops.
 - `igraph_is_chordal()` and `igraph_maximum_cardinality_search()` now support non-simple graphs and directed graphs.
 - `igraph_realize_degree_sequence()` has an additional argument controlling whether multi-edges or self-loops are allowed.
 - `igraph_is_connected()` now returns false for the null graph; see https://github.com/igraph/igraph/issues/1538 for the reasoning behind this decision.
 - `igraph_lapack_ddot()` is renamed to `igraph_blas_ddot()`.
 - `igraph_to_directed()`: added RANDOM and ACYCLIC modes (PR #1511).
 - `igraph_topological_sorting()` now issues an error if the input graph is not acyclic. Previously it issued a warning.
 - `igraph_vector_(which_)(min|max|minmax)()` now handles NaN elements.
 - `igraph_i_set_attribute_table()` is renamed to `igraph_set_attribute_table()`.
 - `igraph_i_sparsemat_view()` is renamed to `igraph_sparsemat_view()`.

### Deprecated

 - `igraph_is_degree_sequence()` and `igraph_is_graphical_degree_sequence()` are deprecated in favour of the newly added `igraph_is_graphical()`.
 - `igraph_closeness_estimate()` is deprecated in favour of the newly added `igraph_closeness_cutoff()`.
 - `igraph_betweenness_estimate()` and `igraph_edge_betweenness_estimate()` are deprecated in favour of the newly added `igraph_betweenness_cutoff()` and `igraph_edge_betweenness_cutoff()`.
 - `igraph_adjlist_remove_duplicate()` and `igraph_inclist_remove_duplicate()` are now deprecated in favour of the new constructor arguments in `igraph_adjlist_init()` and `igraph_inclist_init()`.

### Removed

 - The following functions, all deprecated in igraph 0.6, have been removed (PR #1562):
   * `igraph_adjedgelist_init()`, `igraph_adjedgelist_destroy()`, `igraph_adjedgelist_get()`, `igraph_adjedgelist_print()`, `igraph_adjedgelist_remove_duplicate()`.
   * `igraph_lazy_adjedgelist_init()`, `igraph_lazy_adjedgelist_destroy()`, `igraph_lazy_adjedgelist_get()`, `igraph_lazy_adjedgelist_get_real()`.
   * `igraph_adjacent()`.
   * `igraph_es_adj()`.
   * `igraph_subgraph()`.
 - `igraph_pagerank_old()`, deprecated in 0.7, has been removed.
 - `igraph_vector_bool` and `igraph_matrix_bool` functions that relied on inequality-comparing `igraph_bool_t` values are removed.

### Fixed

 - Betweenness calculations are no longer at risk from integer overflow.
 - The actual cutoff distance used in closeness calculation was one smaller than the `cutoff` parameter. This is corrected (PR #1630).
 - `igraph_layout_gem()` was not interruptible; now it is.
 - `igraph_barabasi_aging_game()` now checks its parameters more carefully.
 - `igraph_callaway_traits_game()` and `igraph_establishment_game()` now check their parameters.
 - `igraph_lastcit_game()` checks its parameters more carefully, and no longer crashes with zero vertices (PR #1625).
 - `igraph_cited_type_game()` incorrectly rounded the attractivity vector entries to integers.
 - `igraph_residual_graph()` now returns the correct _residual_ capacities; previously it wrongly returned the original capacities (PR #1598).
 - `igraph_psumtree_update()` now checks for negative values and NaN.
 - `igraph_communities_spinglass()`: fixed several memory leaks in the `IGRAPH_SPINCOMM_IMP_NEG` implementation.
 - `igraph_incident()` now returns edges in the same order as `igraph_neighbors()`.
 - `igraph_modularity_matrix()` returned incorrect results for weighted graphs. This is now fixed. (PR #1649, thanks to Daniel Noom!)
 - `igraph_lapack_dgetrf()` would crash when passing `NULL` for its `ipiv` argument (thanks for the fix to Daniel Noom).
 - Some `igraph_matrix` functions would fail to report errors on out-of-memory conditions.
 - `igraph_maxdegree()` now returns 0 for the null graph or empty vector set. Previously, it did not handle this case.
 - `igraph_vector_bool_all_e()` now considers all nonzero (i.e. "true") values to be the same.
 - PageRank (PR #1640):
   * `igraph_(personalized_)pagerank(_vs)()` now check their parameters more carefully.
   * `igraph_personalized_pagerank()` no longer modifies its `reset` parameter.
   * `igraph_(personalized_)pagerank(_vs)`: the `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_ARPACK` method now handles self-loops correctly.
   * `igraph_personalized_pagerank(_vs)()`: the result retuned for edgeless or all-zero-weight graphs with the `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_ARPACK` ignored the personalization vector. This is now corrected.
   * `igraph_personalized_pagerank(_vs)()` with a non-uniform personalization vector, a disconnected graph and the `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_PRPACK` method would return results that were inconsistent with `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_ARPACK`. This happened because PRPACK always used a uniform reset distribution when the random walk got stuck in a sink vertex. Now it uses the user-specified reset distribution for this case as well.
 - Fixed crashes in several functions when passing a weighted graph with zero edges (due to `vector_min` being called on the zero-length weight vector).
 - Fixed problems in several functions when passing in a graph with zero vertices.
 - Weighted betweenness, closeness, PageRank, shortest path calculations and random walk functions now check if any weights are NaN.
 - Many functions now reject input arguments containing NaN values.
 - Compatibility with the PGI compiler.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.
 - Improved error and warning messages.
 - More robust error handling.
 - General code cleanup to reduce the number of compiler warnings.
 - igraph's source files have been re-organized for better maintainability.
 - Debugging aid: When igraph is build with AddressSanitizer, the default error handler prints a stack trace before exiting.
 - igraph can now be built with an external CXSparse library.
 - The references to igraph source files in error and warning messages are now always relative to igraph's base directory.
 - When igraph is built as a shared library, only public symbols are exported even on Linux and macOS.

### Acknowledgments

 - Thanks to Daniel Noom for significantly expanding igraph's test coverage and exposing several issues in the process!

## [0.8.5] - 2020-12-07

### Changed

 - `igraph_write_graph_pajek()`: the function now always uses the platform-native line endings (CRLF on Windows, LF on Unix and macOS). Earlier versions tried to enforce Windows line endings, but this was error-prone, and since all recent versions of Pajek support both line endings, enforcing Windows line endings is not necessary any more.

### Fixed

 - Fixed several compilation issues with MINGW32/64 (PR #1554)
 - `igraph_layout_davidson_harel()` was not interruptible; now it is.
 - Added a missing memory cleanup call in `igraph_i_cattribute_combine_vertices()`.
 - Fixed a few memory leaks in test cases.

## [0.8.4] - 2020-11-24

### Fixed

 - `igraph_i_cattribute_combine_vertices()`: fixed invalid cleanup code that eventually filled up the "finally" stack when combining vertices with attributes extensively.
 - `igraph_hrg_sample()`: fixed incorrect function prototype
 - `igraph_is_posinf()` and `igraph_is_neginf()`: fixed incorrect result on platforms where the sign of the result of `isinf()` is not indicative of the sign of the input.
 - Fixed building with vendored LAPACK and external BLAS
 - Fixed building with XCode 12.2 on macOS

### Other

 - Documentation improvements
 - General code cleanup to reduce the number of compiler warnings

## [0.8.3] - 2020-10-02

### Added

 - `igraph_vector_binsearch_slice()` performs binary search on a sorted slice of a vector.

### Changed

 - `igraph_eigenvector_centrality()` assumes the adjacency matrix of undirected graphs to have twice the number of self-loops for each vertex on the diagonal. This makes the results consistent between an undirected graph and its directed equivalent when each edge is replaced by a mutual edge pair.

### Fixed

 - `igraph_isomorphic()` now verifies that the input graphs have no multi-edges (PR #1464).
 - `igraph_difference()` was creating superfluous self loops (#597).
 - `igraph_count_multiple()` was giving incorrect results for self-loops in directed graph (PR #1399).
 - `igraph_betweenness_estimate()`: fixed incorrect results with finite cutoff (PR #1392).
 - `igraph_count_multiple()` was giving incorrect results for self-loops in directed graph (PR #1399).
 - `igraph_eigen_matrix_symmetric()`: fixed incorrect matrix multiplication (PR #1379).
 - Corrected several issues that could arise during an error condition (PRs #1405, #1406, #1438).
 - `igraph_realize_degree_sequence()` did not correctly detect some non-graphical inputs.
 - `igraph_is_graphical_degree_sequence()`: fixed incorrect results in undirected case (PR #1441).
 - `igraph_community_leiden()`: fixed incorrect result when self-loops are present (PR #1476).
 - `igraph_eigenvector_centrality()`: fixed incorrect value for isolated vertices in weighted graphs.
 - `igraph_eigenvector_centrality()`: corrected the handling of self-loops.
 - `igraph_layout_reingold_tilford()`: fixed an issue where branches of the tree would sometimes overlap.

### Other

 - `igraph_degree_sequence_game()`: improved performance with `IGRAPH_DEGSEQ_SIMPLE_NO_MULTIPLE_UNIFORM` method.
 - Improved the robustness of the test suite.
 - Documentation improvements.
 - Improved error and warning messages.
 - Improved compatibility with recent versions of Microsoft Visual C.

## [0.8.2] - 2020-04-28

### Changed

 - Improved argument checking: `igraph_all_st_mincuts()` and `igraph_sir()`
 - Improved interruptibility: `igraph_sir()`

### Fixed

 - `igraph_community_leiden()`: fixed crash when interrupting
 - The tests are now more robust. Some incorrect test failures were fixed when
   running on i386 architecture, or when using different versions of external
   dependencies.

### Other

 - Improved error messages from `igraph_sir()`.
 - Improved compatibility with more recent versions of Microsoft Visual C.

## [0.8.1] - 2020-03-13

### Changed

 - Improved interruptability: `igraph_degree_sequence_game()`
 - Improved argument checking: `igraph_forest_fire_game()`
 - Updated the plfit library to version 0.8.1

### Fixed

 - `igraph_community_edge_betweenness()`: fix for graphs with no edges (PR #1312)
 - `igraph_bridges()` now handles multigraphs correctly (PR #1335)
 - `igraph_avg_nearest_neighbor_degree()`: fix for memory leak in weighted case (PR #1339)
 - `igraph_community_leiden()`: fix crash bug (PR #1357)

### Other

 - Included `ACKOWLEDGEMENTS.md`
 - Documentation improvements
