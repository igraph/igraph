# igraph C library changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

 - In order to facilitate the usage of graphs with more than 2 billion vertices
   and edges, we have made the size of the `igraph_integer_t` data type to be
   32 bits on 32-bit platforms and 64 bits on 64-bit platforms by default. You
   also have the option to compile a 32-bit igraph variant on a 64-bit platform
   by changing the `IGRAPH_INTEGER_SIZE` build variable in CMake to 32.

 - Since `igraph_integer_t` aims to be the largest integer size that is feasible
   on a particular platform, there is no need for generic data types based on
   `long int` any more. The `long` variants of generic data types (e.g.,
   `igraph_vector_long_t`) are therefore removed; you should use the corresponding
   `int` variant instead, whose elements are of type `igraph_integer_t`.

 - Several igraph functions that used to take a `long int` or return a
   `long int` now takes or returns an `igraph_integer_t` instead to make the
   APIs more consistent. Similarly, igraph functions that used `igraph_vector_t`
   for arguments that take or return _integral_ vectors (e.g., vertex or
   edge indices) now take `igraph_vector_int_t` instead. Graph-related functions
   where the API was changed due to this reason are listed below, one by one.

 - Similarly, igraph functions that used to accept the `long` variant of a
   generic igraph data type (e.g., `igraph_vector_long_t`) now take the `int`
   variant of the same data type.

 - `igraph_add_edges()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` for its `edges`
   parameter.

 - `igraph_all_minimal_st_separators()` now returns the separators in
   an `igraph_vector_int_list_t` containing `igraph_vector_int_t` vectors.

 - `igraph_all_st_cuts()` and `igraph_all_st_mincuts()` now return the cuts in
   an `igraph_vector_int_list_t` containing `igraph_vector_int_t` vectors.

   argument instead of `long int`.

   the list of articulation points, not an `igraph_vector_t`.

   `igraph_recent_degree_game()` and `igraph_recent_degree_aging_game()` now use
   an `igraph_vector_int_t` for the out-degree sequence of the nodes being
   generated instead of an `igraph_vector_t`.

 - `igraph_bfs()` now takes an `igraph_vector_int_t` for its `roots`,
   `restricted`, `order`, `father`, `pred`, `succ` and `dist` arguments instead
   of an `igraph_vector_t`.

 - `igraph_bfs_simple()` now takes `igraph_vector_int_t` for its `vids`,
   `layers` and `parents` arguments instead of an `igraph_vector_t`.

 - `igraph_biconnected_components()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` to return
   the list of articulation points, not an `igraph_vector_t`. Also, the members
   of the pointer vectors containing the edges and vertices of the components
   are now of type `igraph_vector_int_t`, not `igraph_vector_t`.

 - `igraph_bipartite_projection()` now uses `igraph_vector_int_t` to return
   `multiplicity1` and `multiplicity2`, not `igraph_vector_t`.

 - `igraph_bridges()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` to return the list of
   bridges, not an `igraph_vector_t`.

 - `igraph_callaway_traits_game()` returns the node types in an `igraph_vector_int_t`
   instead of an `igraph_vector_t`.

   `clique` parameter, and must return an `igraph_error_t`. Use `IGRAPH_STOP`
   as the return code to terminate the search prematurely.

 - The `res` parameter of `igraph_cliques()` is now an `igraph_vector_int_list_t`.

 - `igraph_closeness()` and `igraph_closeness_cutoff()` now use an
   `igraph_vector_int_t` to return `reachable_count`, not an `igraph_vector_t`.

 - `igraph_cohesive_blocks()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` to return the
   mapping from block indices to parent block indices, and the `cohesion`; also, it uses a pointer
   vector of `igraph_vector_int_t`s to return the blocks themselves instead of
   a pointer vector of `igraph_vector_t`.

   `igraph_community_eb_get_merges()`, `igraph_community_fastgreedy()`,
   `igraph_community_to_membership()`, `igraph_le_community_to_membership()`,
   `igraph_community_leading_eigenvector()` now use an `igraph_vector_int_t`
   for their `merges` parameter.

 - `igraph_community_edge_betweenness()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` to
   return the edge IDs in the order of their removal as well as the list of edge
   IDs whose removal broke a single component into two.

 - `igraph_community_fluid_communities()` does not provide the modularity in a
   separate output argument any more; use `igraph_modularity()` to retrieve the
   modularity if you need it.

 - `igraph_community_label_propagation()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` for its
   `initial` parameter. It also takes a `mode` argument that specifies how
   labels should be propagated along edges (forward, backward or ignoring edge
   directions).

 - `igraph_community_label_propagation()` does not provide the modularity in a
   separate output argument any more; use `igraph_modularity()` to retrieve the
   modularity if you need it.

   values.

   `minelements` arguments instead of a `long int`.

 - `igraph_degree()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` to return the degrees.
   If you need the degrees in a vector containing floating-point numbers
   instead (e.g., because you want to pass them on to some other function that
   takes an `igraph_vector_t`), use `igraph_strength()` instead with a null
   weight vector.

 - `igraph_degree_sequence_game()` now takes degree sequences represented as
   `igraph_vector_int_t` instead of `igraph_vector_t`.

 - `igraph_degseq_t`, used by `igraph_degree_sequence_game()`, uses new names
   for its constants. The old names are deprecated, but retained for compatibility.
   See `igraph_constants.h` to see which new name corresponds to which old one.

   return the mapping and the inverse mapping of old vertex IDs to new ones.

   in an `igraph_vector_int_t` instead of an `igraph_int_t`.

 - `igraph_dfs()` now takes an `igraph_vector_int_t` for its `order`, `order_out`,
   `father` and `dist` arguments instead of an `igraph_vector_t`. Furthermore,
   these vectors will contain -2 for vertices that have not been visited; in

   used in the `father` vector to indicate the root of a DFS tree.

   in an Eulerian path or cycle instead of an `igraph_vector_t`.

   IDs of the edges in the feedback arc set instead of an `igraph_vector_t`.

 - `igraph_get_adjacency_sparse()` now returns the sparse adjacency matrix in
   an `igraph_sparsemat_t` structure, and it assumes that the input matrix is
   _initialized_ for sake of consistency with other igraph functions.

 - `igraph_get_edgelist()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` for its
   `res` parameter.

 - `igraph_get_eids()` now uses `igraph_vector_int_t` to return lists of edge IDs
   and to receive lists of vertex IDs.

 - The `path` argument of `igraph_get_eids()` was removed. You can replicate the
   old behaviour by constructing the list of vertex IDs explicitly from the
   path by duplicating each vertex in the path except the first and last ones.
   A helper function called `igraph_expand_path_to_pairs()` is provided to ease
   the transition.

 - `igraph_get_eids_multi()` was removed as its design was fundamentally broken;
   there was no way to retrieve the IDs of all edges between a specific pair of
   vertices without knowing in advance how many such edges there are in the graph.

 - `igraph_get_incidence()` now returns the vertex IDs corresponding to the
   rows and columns of the incidence matrix as `igraph_vector_int_t`.

   `igraph_vector_long_t`.

   `igraph_get_all_shortest_paths_dijkstra()`, `igraph_get_shortest_paths()`,
   `igraph_get_shortesT_paths_bellman_ford()` and
   `igraph_get_shortest_paths_dijkstra()` now contain `igraph_vector_int_t` vectors
   instead of `igraph_vector_t`.

   `igraph_get_subisomorphisms_vf2()` are now of type `igraph_vector_int_list_t`.

   an `igraph_sparsemat_t` structure, and it assumes that the input matrix is
   _initialized_ for sake of consistency with other igraph functions.

   instead of an `igraph_vector_t`.

 - `igraph_hrg_predict()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` for its
   `edges` parameter.

 - `igraph_hrg_sample()` now always samples a single graph only. Use
   `igraph_hrg_sample_many()` if you need more than one sample, and call
   `igraph_hrg_fit()` beforehand if you do not have a HRG model but only a
   single input graph.

 - `igraph_incident()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` for its
   `eids` parameter.

   use an `igraph_vector_int_t` to return the matching instead of an
   `igraph_vector_long_t`.

   `igraph_vector_int_t` instead of `igraph_vector_t`.

   used to be called `igraph_isomorphic_function_vf2()`) and
   `igraph_isohandler_t` now all use `igraph_vector_int_t` for their `map12` and

   and `map21` parameters.

 - The `maps` parameters in `igraph_subisomorphic_lad()`,
   `igraph_get_isomorphisms_vf2()` and `igraph_get_subisomorphisms_vf2()` are
   now of type `igraph_vector_int_list_t`.

 - `igraph_subisomorphic_lad()` now uses an `igraph_vector_int_t` for its `map`
   parameter. Also, its `domains` parameter is now a pointer vector containing

 - The `res` parameter of `igraph_weighted_cliques()` is now an
   `igraph_vector_int_list_t`.

   target vertex index instead of a `long int`.

 - `igraph_vector_*()`, `igraph_matrix_*()`, `igraph_stack_*()`, `igraph_array_*()`
   and several other generic igraph data types now use `igraph_integer_t` for
   indexing, _not_ `long int`. Please refer to the headers for the exact details;
   the list of affected functions is too large to include here.

 - `igraph_vector_order()` was removed; use `igraph_vector_int_pair_order()` instead.
   (The original function worked for vectors containing integers only).

 - `igraph_vector_qsort_ind()` and its variants now take an `igraph_order_t` enum
   instead of a boolean to denote whether the order should be ascending or
   descending.

 - The `add_edges()` function in the attribute handler now takes an
   `igraph_vector_int_t` for its `edges` parameter instead of an
   `igraph_vector_t`. The `add_vertices()` function now takes an
   `igraph_integer_t` for the vertex count instead of a `long int`. The

   attribute types. The `permute_vertices()` and `permute_edges()` functions in
   the attribute handler tables now take an `igraph_vector_int_t` instead of an
   `igraph_vector_t` for the index vectors. These are relevant only to maintainers
   of higher level interfaces to igraph; they should update their attribute
   handlers accordingly.

 - igraph functions that interface with external libraries such as BLAS or LAPACK
   may now fail if the underlying BLAS or LAPACK implementation cannot handle
   the size of input vectors or matrices (BLAS and LAPACK are usually limited to
   vectors whose size fits in an `int`). `igraph_blas_dgemv()` and
   `igraph_blas_dgemv_array()` thus now return an `igraph_error_t`, which may be
   set to `IGRAPH_EOVERFLOW` if the input vectors or matrices are too large.

 - `igraph_sparsemat_transpose()` now takes an `igraph_bool_t` as its `values`
   argument instead of an `int`. In practice, it has always been treated as a
   boolean.

 - Functions that used an `igraph_vector_t` to represent cluster size
   and cluster membership now use an `igraph_vector_int_t` instead. These are:
   - `igraph_connected_components()` (used to be `igraph_clusters()` in 0.9 and before)
   - `igraph_community_eb_get_merges()`
   - `igraph_community_edge_betweenness()`
   - `igraph_community_fastgreedy()`

   - `igraph_community_spinglass_single()`
   - `igraph_community_to_membership()`
   - `igraph_community_walktrap()`
   - `igraph_compare_communities()`
   - `igraph_le_community_to_membership()`
   - `igraph_modularity()`
   - `igraph_reindex_membership()`
   - `igraph_split_join_distance()`
   `igraph_community_multilevel()` additionaly uses a `igraph_matrix_int_t`
   instead of `igraph_matrix_t()` for its memberships parameter.

 - Every `igraph_spmatrix_*()` function and struct now uses `igraph_integer_t`
   instead of `long int` for the numbers of rows and columns, and row and column
   indexes. Note that `igraph_spmatrix_t` itself has been deprecated in favour
   of `igraph_sparsemat_t`.

 - `IGRAPH_TOTAL` was removed from the `igraph_neimode_t` enum; use `IGRAPH_ALL`
   instead.

### Added

 - `igraph_adjlist_init_from_inclist()` to create an adjacency list from an already existing incidence list by resolving edge IDs to their corresponding endpoints. This function is useful for algorithms when both an adjacency and an incidence list is needed and they should be in the same order.
 - `igraph_vector_*_permute()` functions to permute a vector based on an index vector.
 - `igraph_vector_*_remove_fast()` functions to remove an item from a vector by swapping it with the last element and then popping it off. It allows one to remove an item from a vector in constant time if the order of items does not matter.
 - `igraph_vector_ptr_sort_ind()` to obtain an index vector that would sort a vector of pointers based on some comparison function.
 - `igraph_hub_and_authority_scores()` calculates the hub and authority scores of a graph as a matching pair.

 - `igraph_es_all_between()` to create an edge selector that selects all edges between a pair of vertices.
 - `igraph_blas_dgemm()` to multiply two matrices.
 - `igraph_wheel()` to create a wheel graph (#1938, thanks to @kwofach).
 - `igraph_stack_capacity()` to query the capacity of a stack.

### Removed

 - The type `igraph_stack_ptr_t`, `igraph_stack_ptr_free_all()` and `igraph_stack_ptr_destroy_all()` are removed. Use `igraph_vector_ptr_t` and associated functions instead.

### Changed

 - `igraph_version()` no longer returns an error code.
 - `igraph_write_graph_ncol()` now preserves the edge ordering of the graph when writing an NCOL file.
 - The Pajek parser is now less strict and accepts more files.
  - `igraph_degree_sequence_game()` now supports an additional method, `IGRAPH_DEGSEQ_EDGE_SWITCHING_SIMPLE`,
    and edge-switching MCMC sampler.

### Fixed

 - When an error occurs during parsing DL, GML, NCOL, LGL or Pajek files, line numbers are now reported correctly.
 - The GraphML parser does not print to stderr any more in case of encoding
   errors and other error conditions originating from the underlying `libxml2`
   library.
 - The GML parser no longer mixes up Inf and NaN and -Inf now works.

### Deprecated

 - `igraph_clusters()` has been renamed to `igraph_connected_components()`; the
   old name is deprecated and will be removed in 0.11.

 - `igraph_get_stochastic_sparsemat()` has been renamed to `igraph_get_stochastic_sparse()`;
   the old name is deprecated and will be removed in 0.11.

 - `igraph_spmatrix_t` and its related functions are deprecated in favour of
   `igraph_sparsemat_t`. These will be removed in 0.11.

 - `igraph_tree()` has been renamed to `igraph_kary_tree()`; the old name is
   deprecated and will be removed in 0.11.

 - The macros `igraph_Calloc`, `igraph_Realloc` and `igraph_Free` have been
   deprecated in favour of `IGRAPH_CALLOC`, `IGRAPH_REALLOC` and `IGRAPH_FREE`
   to simplify the API. The deprecated variants will be removed in 0.11.

## [Unreleased 0.9.7]

### Changed

 - `igraph_get_all_shortest_paths_dijsktra()` now uses tolerances when comparing path
   lengths, and is thus robust to numerical roundoff errors.

### Fixed

 - NCOL and LGL format writers no longer accept "name" and "weight" attributes
   of invalid types.
 - The LGL writer could not access numerical weight attributes, potentially leading
   to crashes.
 - External PLFIT libraries and their headers are now detected at their standard
   installation location.
 - `igraph_vector_init()` no longer accepts negative vector sizes.

### Other

 - The C attribute handler now verifies attribute types when retrieving attributes.
 - Documentation improvements

## [0.9.6] - 2022-01-05

 - Isomorphism class functions (`igraph_isoclass()`, `igraph_isoclass_subgraph()`,
   `igraph_isoclass_create`) and motif finder functions (`igraph_motifs_randesu()`,
   `igraph_motifs_randesu_estimate()`, `igraph_motifs_randesu_callback()`) now
   support undirected (sub)graphs of sizes 5 and 6. Previsouly only sizes 3 and 4
   were supported.

### Fixed

 - igraph would not build with MinGW when using the vendored GLPK and enabling TLS.
 - Removed some uses of `abort()` from vendored libraries, which could unexpectedly
   shut down the host language of igraph's high-level interfaces.
 - `igraph_community_label_propagation()` no longer leaves any vertices unlabeled
   when they were not reachable from any labeled ones, i.e. the returned membership
   vector is guaranteed not to contain negative values (#1853).
 - The Kamada-Kawai layout is now interruptible.
 - The Fruchterman-Reingold layout is now interruptible.
 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_cmp_epsilon()` that resulted in incorrect results for
   edge betweenness calculations in certain rare cases with x87 floating point
   math when LTO was also enabled (#1894).
 - Weighted clique related functions now fall back to the unweighted variants
   when a null vertex weight vector is given to them.
 - `igraph_erdos_renyi_game_(gnm|gnp)` would not produce self-loops for the singleton
   graph.
 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_local_efficiency()` that sometimes erroneously
   reported zero as the local efficiency of a vertex in directed graphs.
 - `igraph_vector_update()` (and its type-specific variants) did not check for
   memory allocation failure.
 - Fixed a potential crash in the GraphML reader that would be triggered by some
   invalid GraphML files.

### Other

 - `igraph_is_tree()` has improved performance and memory usage.
 - `igraph_is_connected()` has improved performance when checking weak connectedness.
 - Improved error handling in `igraph_maximal_cliques()` and related functions.
 - The build system now checks that GLPK is of a compatible version (4.57 or later).
 - The vendored `plfit` package was updated to 0.9.3.
 - You can now build igraph with an external `plfit` instead of the vendored one.
 - Documentation improvements.

## [0.9.5] - 2021-11-11

### Fixed

 - `igraph_reindex_membership()` does not allow negative membership indices any more.

 - `igraph_rewire_directed_edges()` now generates multigraphs when edge directions
   are ignored, to make it consistent with the directed case.

 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_gomory_hu_tree()` that returned only the equivalent flow
   tree instead of the cut tree (#1810).

 - Fixed a bug in the `IGRAPH_TO_UNDIRECTED_COLLAPSE` mode of
   `igraph_to_undirected()` that provided an incorrect merge vector to the
   attribute handler, leading to problems when edge attributes were merged
   using an attribute combination (#1814).

 - Fixed the behaviour of the `IGRAPH_ENABLE_LTO` option when it was set to
   `AUTO`; earlier versions had a bug where `AUTO` simply checked whether LTO
   is supported but then did not use LTO even if it was supported.

 - When using igraph from a CMake project, it is now checked that the project has
   the C++ language enabled. This is necessary for linking to igraph with CMake.

### Other

 - Improved the root selection method for disconnected graphs in the
   Reingold-Tilford layout (#1836). The new root selection method provides
   niceer results if the graph is not a tree, although it is still recommended
   to use the Sugiyama layout instead, unless the input graph is _almost_ a
   tree, in which case Reingold-Tilfold may still be preferred.

 - `igraph_decompose()` is now much faster for large graphs containing many
   isolates or small components (#960).

 - `igraph_largest_cliques()` and `igraph_clique_number()` were re-written to
   use `igraph_maximal_cliques_callback()` so they are much faster now (#804).

 - The vendored GLPK has been upgraded to GLPK 5.0.

 - Documentation improvements.

## [0.9.4] - 2021-05-31

### Changed

 - Unweighted transitivity (i.e. clustering coefficient) calculations now ignore multi-edges and edge directions instead of rejecting multigraphs and directed graphs.
 - `igraph_transitivity_barrat()` now returns an error code if the input graph has multiple edges (which is not handled correctly by the implementation yet).

### Fixed

 - `igraph_local_scan_k_ecount()` now handles loops correctly.
 - `igraph_transitivity_avglocal_undirected()` is no longer slower than `igraph_transitivity_local_undirected()`.
 - Worked around an invalid warning issued by Clang 9.0 when compiling with OpenMP.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.

## [0.9.3] - 2021-05-05

### Added

 - `igraph_trussness()` calculates the trussness of each edge in the graph (PR #1034, thanks to Alex Perrone and Fabio Zanini)
 - OpenMP is now enabled and used by certain functions (notably PageRank calculation) when the compiler supports it. Set `IGRAPH_OPENMP_SUPPORT=OFF` at configuration time to disable this.

### Fixed

 - `igraph_get_incidence()` no longer reads and writes out of bounds when given a non-bipartite graph, but gives a warning and ignores edges within a part.
 - `igraph_dyad_census()` no longer reports an overflow on singleton graphs, and handles loops and multigraphs correctly. Undirected graphs are handled consistently and will no longer give a warning.
 - `igraph_vector_lex_cmp()` and `igraph_vector_colex_cmp()` dereferenced their arguments only once instead of twice, and therefore did not work with `igraph_vector_ptr_sort()`.
 - `igraph_maximal_cliques_subset()` and `igraph_transitivity_barrat()` corrupted the error handling stack ("finally stack") under some circumstances.
 - CMake package files did not respect `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`. This only affected Linux distributions which install into `lib64` or other locations instead of `lib`.
 - The parser sources could not be generated when igraph was in a location that contained spaces in its path.
 - igraph no longer links to the math library (`libm`) when this is not necessary.
 - `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS` is now defined during compilation to enable compatibility with UWP.
 - Fixed a compilation issue on MSYS / MinGW when link-time optimization was enabled and the `MSYS Makefiles` CMake generator was used. Some source files in igraph were renamed as a consequence, but these should not affect users of the library.

### Deprecated

 - `igraph_rng_min()` is now deprecated; assume a constant zero as its return value if you used this function in your own code.

### Other

 - Updated the vendored CXSparse library to version 3.2.0

## [0.9.2] - 2021-04-14

### Added

 - CMake package files are now installed with igraph. This allows `find_package(igraph)` to find igraph and detect the appropriate compilation options for projects that link to it.

### Fixed

 - igraph can now be used as a CMake subproject in other CMake-based projects.
 - The documentaton can now be built from the release tarball.
 - Configuration will no longer fail when the release tarball is extracted into a subdirectory of an unrelated git repository.
 - The generated pkg-config file was incorrect when `CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>` variables were absolute paths.
 - On Unix-like systems, the library name is now `libigraph.so.0.0.0`, as it used to be for igraph 0.8 and earlier.
 - Fixed a return type mismatch in parser sources, and fixed some warnings with recent versions of gcc.
 - Fixed a bug in `igraph_get_shortest_paths_dijkstra()` and `igraph_get_shortest_paths_bellman_ford()` that returned incorrect results for unreachable vertices.

### Other

 - Improved installation instructions and tutorial.

## [0.9.1] - 2021-03-23

### Added

 - `igraph_vector_lex_cmp()` and `igraph_vector_colex_cmp()` for lexicographic
   and colexicographic comparison of vectors. These functions may also be used
   for sorting.

### Changed

 - `igraph_community_multilevel()` is now randomized (PR #1696, thanks to Daniel Noom).

### Fixed

 - CMake settings that controlled the library installation directory name, such as `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`, were not respected.
 - Under some conditions, the generated pkg-config file contained an incorrect include directory path.
 - The following functions were not exported from the shared library: `igraph_subcomponent()`, `igraph_stack_ptr_free_all()`, `igraph_stack_ptr_destroy_all()`, `igraph_status_handler_stderr()`, `igraph_progress_handler_stderr()`.
 - Built-in random number generators (`igraph_rngtype_mt19937`, `igraph_rngtype_rand`, `igraph_rngtype_glibc2`) were not exported from the shared library.
 - `igraph_layout_graphopt()` no longer rounds the `spring_length` parameter to an integer.
 - `igraph_get_all_shortest_paths_dijkstra()` no longer modifies the `res` vector's item destructor.
 - `igraph_get_shortest_path_bellman_ford()` did not work correctly when calculating paths to all vertices.
 - `igraph_arpack_rnsolve()` checks its parameters more carefully.
 - `igraph_community_to_membership()` does not crash anymore when `csize` is requested but `membership` is not.
 - `igraph_citing_cited_type_game()`: fixed memory leaks (PR #1700, thanks to Daniel Noom).
 - `igraph_transitivity_undirected()`, `igraph_transitivity_avglocal_undirected()` and `igraph_transitivity_barrat()` no longer trigger an assertion failure when used with the null graph (PRs #1709, #1710).
 - `igraph_(personalized_)pagerank()` would return incorrect results for weighted multigraphs with fewer than 128 vertices when using `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_PRPACK`.
 - `igraph_diversity()` now checks its input more carefully, and throws an error when the input graph has multi-edges or is directed.
 - `igraph_shortest_paths_johnson()` would return incorrect results when the `to` argument differed from `from` (thanks to Daniel Noom).
 - `igraph_is_graphical()` would fail to set the result variable for certain special degree sequences in the undirected simple graph case.
 - Non-maximal clique finding functions would sometimes return incomplete results when finding more than 2147483647 (i.e. 2^31 - 1) cliques.
 - GLPK internal errors no longer crash igraph.
 - Fixed some potential memory leaks that could happen on error conditions or when certain functions were interrupted.
 - When testing a DLL build on Windows, the `PATH` was sometimes not set correctly, causing the tests to fail (PR #1692).
 - When compiling from the git repository (as opposed to the release tarball), the build would fail with recent versions of `bison` and `flex`.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.
 - Much faster documentation builds.
 - Allow using a pre-generated `arith.h` header for f2c when cross-compiling; see the Installation section of the documentation.
 - The `IGRAPH_ENABLE_LTO` build option now supports the `AUTO` value, which uses LTO only if the compiler supports it. Warning: CMake may not always be able to detect that LTO is not fully supported. Therefore, the default setting is `OFF`.
 - The following functions are now interruptible: `igraph_grg_game()`, `igraph_sbm_game()`, `igraph_barabasi_game()`, `igraph_barabasi_aging_game()`.
 - Functions that use GLPK, such as `igraph_feedback_arc_set()` and `igraph_community_optimal_modularity()` are now interruptible.
 - Add support for older versions of Clang that do not recognize the `-Wno-varargs` flag.

### Acknowledgments

 - Big thanks to Daniel Noom for continuing to expand the test suite and discovering and fixing several bugs in the process!

## [0.9.0] - 2021-02-16

### Added

 - Eulerian paths/cycles (PR #1346):
   * `igraph_is_eulerian()` finds out whether an Eulerian path/cycle exists.
   * `igraph_eulerian_path()` returns an Eulerian path.
   * `igraph_eulerian_cycle()` returns an Eulerian cycle.
 - Efficiency (PR #1344):
   * `igraph_global_efficiency()` computes the global efficiency of a network.
   * `igraph_local_efficiency()` computes the local efficiency around each vertex.
   * `igraph_average_local_efficiency()` computes the mean local efficiency.
 - Degree sequences (PR #1445):
   * `igraph_is_graphical()` checks if a degree sequence has a realization as a simple or multigraph, with or without self-loops.
   * `igraph_is_bigraphical()` checks if two degree sequences have a realization as a bipartite graph.
   * `igraph_realize_degree_sequence()` now supports constructing non-simple graphs as well.
 - There is a new fatal error handling mechanism (PR #1548):
   * `igraph_set_fatal_handler()` sets the fatal error handler. It is the only function in this functionality group that is relevant to end users.
   * The macro `IGRAPH_FATAL()` and the functions `igraph_fatal()` and `igraph_fatalf()` raise a fatal error. These are for internal use.
   * `IGRAPH_ASSERT()` is a replacement for the `assert()` macro. It is for internal use.
   * `igraph_fatal_handler_abort()` is the default fatal error handler.
 - The new `IGRAPH_WARNINGF`, `IGRAPH_ERRORF` and `IGRAPH_FATALF` macros provide warning/error reporting with `printf`-like syntax. (PR #1627, thanks to Daniel Noom!)
 - `igraph_average_path_length_dijkstra()` computes the mean shortest path length in weighted graphs (PR #1344).
 - `igraph_get_shortest_paths_bellman_ford()` computes the shortest paths (including the vertex and edge IDs along the paths) using the Bellman-Ford algorithm (PR #1642, thanks to Guy Rozenberg). This makes it possible to calculate the shortest paths on graphs with negative edge weights, which was not possible before with Dijkstra's algorithm.
 - `igraph_get_shortest_path_bellman_ford()` is a wrapper for `igraph_get_shortest_paths_bellman_ford()` for the single path case.
 - `igraph_is_same_graph()` cheks that two labelled graphs are the same (PR #1604).
 - Harmonic centrality (PR #1583):
   * `igraph_harmonic_centrality()` computes the harmonic centrality of vertices.
   * `igraph_harmonic_centrality_cutoff()` computes the range-limited harmonic centrality.
 - Range-limited centralities, currently equivalent to the old functions with names ending in `_estimate` (PR #1583):
   * `igraph_closeness_cutoff()`.
   * `igraph_betweenness_cutoff()`.
   * `igraph_edge_betweenness_cutoff()`.

 - `igraph_inclist_size()` returns the number of vertices in an incidence list.
 - `igraph_lazy_adjlist_size()` returns the number of vertices in a lazy adjacency list.
 - `igraph_lazy_inclist_size()` returns the number of vertices in a lazy incidence list.
 - `igraph_bfs_simple()` now provides a simpler interface to the breadth-first search functionality.

### Changed

 - igraph now uses a CMake-based build sysyem.
 - GMP support can no longer be disabled. When GMP is not present on the system, igraph will use an embedded copy of Mini-GMP (PR #1549).
 - Bliss has been updated to version 0.75. Bliss functions are now interruptible. Thanks to Tommi Junttila for making this possible!
 - Adjacency and incidence lists:
   * `igraph_adjlist_init()` and `igraph_lazy_adjlist_init()` now require the caller to specify what to do with loop and multiple edges.
   * `igraph_inclist_init()` and `igraph_lazy_inclist_init()` now require the caller to specify what to do with loop edges.
   * Adjacency and incidence lists now use `igraph_vector_int_t` consistently.
 - Community detection:
   * `igraph_community_multilevel()`: added resolution parameter.
   * `igraph_community_fluid_communities()`: graphs with no vertices or with one vertex only are now supported; they return a trivial partition.
 - Modularity:
   * `igraph_modularity()` and `igraph_modularity_matrix()`: added resolution parameter.
   * `igraph_modularity()` and `igraph_modularity_matrix()` now support the directed version of modularity.
   * `igraph_modularity()` returns NaN for graphs with no edges to indicate that the modularity is not well-defined for such graphs.
 - Centralities:
   * `cutoff=0` is no longer interpreted as infinity (i.e. no cutoff) in `betweenness`, `edge_betweenness` and `closeness`. If no cutoff is desired, use a negative value such as `cutoff=-1`.
   * The `nobigint` argument has been removed from `igraph_betweenness()`, `igraph_betweenness_estimate()` and `igraph_centralization_betweenness()`, as it is not longer needed. The current implementation is more accurate than the old one using big integers.
   * `igraph_closeness()` now considers only reachable vertices during the calculation (i.e. the closeness is calculated per-component in the undirected case) (PR #1630).
   * `igraph_closeness()` gained two additional output parameters, `reachable_count` and `all_reachable`, returning the number of reached vertices from each vertex, as well as whether all vertices were reachable. This allows for computing various generalizations of closeness for disconnected graphs (PR #1630).
   * `igraph_pagerank()`, `igraph_personalized_pagerank()` and `igraph_personalized_pagerank_vs()` no longer support the `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_POWER` method. Their `options` argument now has type `igraph_arpack_options_t *` instead of `void *`.
 - Shortest paths (PR #1344):
   * `igraph_average_path_length()` now returns the number of disconnected vertex pairs in the new `unconn_pairs` output argument.
   * `igraph_diameter()` now return the result as an `igraph_real_t` instead of an `igraph_integer_t`.
   * `igraph_average_path_length()`  and `igraph_diameter()` now return `IGRAPH_INFINITY` when `unconn=FALSE` and the graph is not connected. Previously they returned the number of vertices.
 - Trait-based random graph generators:
   * `igraph_callaway_traits_game()` and `igraph_establishment_game()` now have an optional output argument to retrieve the generated vertex types.
   * `igraph_callaway_traits_game()` and `igraph_establishment_game()` now allow omitting the type distribution vector, in which case they assume a uniform distribution.
   * `igraph_asymmetric_preference_game()` now accept a different number of in-types and out-types.
 - `igraph_subisomorphic_lad()` now supports graphs with self-loops.
 - `igraph_is_chordal()` and `igraph_maximum_cardinality_search()` now support non-simple graphs and directed graphs.
 - `igraph_realize_degree_sequence()` has an additional argument controlling whether multi-edges or self-loops are allowed.
 - `igraph_is_connected()` now returns false for the null graph; see https://github.com/igraph/igraph/issues/1538 for the reasoning behind this decision.
 - `igraph_lapack_ddot()` is renamed to `igraph_blas_ddot()`.
 - `igraph_to_directed()`: added RANDOM and ACYCLIC modes (PR #1511).
 - `igraph_topological_sorting()` now issues an error if the input graph is not acyclic. Previously it issued a warning.
 - `igraph_vector_(which_)(min|max|minmax)()` now handles NaN elements.
 - `igraph_i_set_attribute_table()` is renamed to `igraph_set_attribute_table()`.
 - `igraph_i_sparsemat_view()` is renamed to `igraph_sparsemat_view()`.

### Deprecated

 - `igraph_is_degree_sequence()` and `igraph_is_graphical_degree_sequence()` are deprecated in favour of the newly added `igraph_is_graphical()`.
 - `igraph_closeness_estimate()` is deprecated in favour of the newly added `igraph_closeness_cutoff()`.
 - `igraph_betweenness_estimate()` and `igraph_edge_betweenness_estimate()` are deprecated in favour of the newly added `igraph_betweenness_cutoff()` and `igraph_edge_betweenness_cutoff()`.
 - `igraph_adjlist_remove_duplicate()` and `igraph_inclist_remove_duplicate()` are now deprecated in favour of the new constructor arguments in `igraph_adjlist_init()` and `igraph_inclist_init()`.

### Removed

 - The following functions, all deprecated in igraph 0.6, have been removed (PR #1562):
   * `igraph_adjedgelist_init()`, `igraph_adjedgelist_destroy()`, `igraph_adjedgelist_get()`, `igraph_adjedgelist_print()`, `igraph_adjedgelist_remove_duplicate()`.
   * `igraph_lazy_adjedgelist_init()`, `igraph_lazy_adjedgelist_destroy()`, `igraph_lazy_adjedgelist_get()`, `igraph_lazy_adjedgelist_get_real()`.
   * `igraph_adjacent()`.
   * `igraph_es_adj()`.
   * `igraph_subgraph()`.
 - `igraph_pagerank_old()`, deprecated in 0.7, has been removed.
 - `igraph_vector_bool` and `igraph_matrix_bool` functions that relied on inequality-comparing `igraph_bool_t` values are removed.

### Fixed

 - Betweenness calculations are no longer at risk from integer overflow.
 - The actual cutoff distance used in closeness calculation was one smaller than the `cutoff` parameter. This is corrected (PR #1630).
 - `igraph_layout_gem()` was not interruptible; now it is.
 - `igraph_barabasi_aging_game()` now checks its parameters more carefully.
 - `igraph_callaway_traits_game()` and `igraph_establishment_game()` now check their parameters.
 - `igraph_lastcit_game()` checks its parameters more carefully, and no longer crashes with zero vertices (PR #1625).
 - `igraph_cited_type_game()` incorrectly rounded the attractivity vector entries to integers.
 - `igraph_residual_graph()` now returns the correct _residual_ capacities; previously it wrongly returned the original capacities (PR #1598).
 - `igraph_psumtree_update()` now checks for negative values and NaN.
 - `igraph_communities_spinglass()`: fixed several memory leaks in the `IGRAPH_SPINCOMM_IMP_NEG` implementation.
 - `igraph_incident()` now returns edges in the same order as `igraph_neighbors()`.
 - `igraph_modularity_matrix()` returned incorrect results for weighted graphs. This is now fixed. (PR #1649, thanks to Daniel Noom!)
 - `igraph_lapack_dgetrf()` would crash when passing `NULL` for its `ipiv` argument (thanks for the fix to Daniel Noom).
 - Some `igraph_matrix` functions would fail to report errors on out-of-memory conditions.
 - `igraph_maxdegree()` now returns 0 for the null graph or empty vector set. Previously, it did not handle this case.
 - `igraph_vector_bool_all_e()` now considers all nonzero (i.e. "true") values to be the same.
 - PageRank (PR #1640):
   * `igraph_(personalized_)pagerank(_vs)()` now check their parameters more carefully.
   * `igraph_personalized_pagerank()` no longer modifies its `reset` parameter.
   * `igraph_(personalized_)pagerank(_vs)`: the `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_ARPACK` method now handles self-loops correctly.
   * `igraph_personalized_pagerank(_vs)()`: the result retuned for edgeless or all-zero-weight graphs with the `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_ARPACK` ignored the personalization vector. This is now corrected.
   * `igraph_personalized_pagerank(_vs)()` with a non-uniform personalization vector, a disconnected graph and the `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_PRPACK` method would return results that were inconsistent with `IGRAPH_PAGERANK_ALGO_ARPACK`. This happened because PRPACK always used a uniform reset distribution when the random walk got stuck in a sink vertex. Now it uses the user-specified reset distribution for this case as well.
 - Fixed crashes in several functions when passing a weighted graph with zero edges (due to `vector_min` being called on the zero-length weight vector).
 - Fixed problems in several functions when passing in a graph with zero vertices.
 - Weighted betweenness, closeness, PageRank, shortest path calculations and random walk functions now check if any weights are NaN.
 - Many functions now reject input arguments containing NaN values.
 - Compatibility with the PGI compiler.

### Other

 - Documentation improvements.
 - Improved error and warning messages.
 - More robust error handling.
 - General code cleanup to reduce the number of compiler warnings.
 - igraph's source files have been re-organized for better maintainability.
 - Debugging aid: When igraph is build with AddressSanitizer, the default error handler prints a stack trace before exiting.
 - igraph can now be built with an external CXSparse library.
 - The references to igraph source files in error and warning messages are now always relative to igraph's base directory.
 - When igraph is built as a shared library, only public symbols are exported even on Linux and macOS.

### Acknowledgments

 - Thanks to Daniel Noom for significantly expanding igraph's test coverage and exposing several issues in the process!

## [0.8.5] - 2020-12-07

### Changed

 - `igraph_write_graph_pajek()`: the function now always uses the platform-native line endings (CRLF on Windows, LF on Unix and macOS). Earlier versions tried to enforce Windows line endings, but this was error-prone, and since all recent versions of Pajek support both line endings, enforcing Windows line endings is not necessary any more.

### Fixed

 - Fixed several compilation issues with MINGW32/64 (PR #1554)
 - `igraph_layout_davidson_harel()` was not interruptible; now it is.
 - Added a missing memory cleanup call in `igraph_i_cattribute_combine_vertices()`.
 - Fixed a few memory leaks in test cases.

## [0.8.4] - 2020-11-24

### Fixed

 - `igraph_i_cattribute_combine_vertices()`: fixed invalid cleanup code that eventually filled up the "finally" stack when combining vertices with attributes extensively.
 - `igraph_hrg_sample()`: fixed incorrect function prototype
 - `igraph_is_posinf()` and `igraph_is_neginf()`: fixed incorrect result on platforms where the sign of the result of `isinf()` is not indicative of the sign of the input.
 - Fixed building with vendored LAPACK and external BLAS
 - Fixed building with XCode 12.2 on macOS

### Other

 - Documentation improvements
 - General code cleanup to reduce the number of compiler warnings

## [0.8.3] - 2020-10-02

### Added

 - `igraph_vector_binsearch_slice()` performs binary search on a sorted slice of a vector.

### Changed

 - `igraph_eigenvector_centrality()` assumes the adjacency matrix of undirected graphs to have twice the number of self-loops for each vertex on the diagonal. This makes the results consistent between an undirected graph and its directed equivalent when each edge is replaced by a mutual edge pair.

### Fixed

 - `igraph_isomorphic()` now verifies that the input graphs have no multi-edges (PR #1464).
 - `igraph_difference()` was creating superfluous self loops (#597).
 - `igraph_count_multiple()` was giving incorrect results for self-loops in directed graph (PR #1399).
 - `igraph_betweenness_estimate()`: fixed incorrect results with finite cutoff (PR #1392).
 - `igraph_count_multiple()` was giving incorrect results for self-loops in directed graph (PR #1399).
 - `igraph_eigen_matrix_symmetric()`: fixed incorrect matrix multiplication (PR #1379).
 - Corrected several issues that could arise during an error condition (PRs #1405, #1406, #1438).
 - `igraph_realize_degree_sequence()` did not correctly detect some non-graphical inputs.
 - `igraph_is_graphical_degree_sequence()`: fixed incorrect results in undirected case (PR #1441).
 - `igraph_community_leiden()`: fixed incorrect result when self-loops are present (PR #1476).
 - `igraph_eigenvector_centrality()`: fixed incorrect value for isolated vertices in weighted graphs.
 - `igraph_eigenvector_centrality()`: corrected the handling of self-loops.
 - `igraph_layout_reingold_tilford()`: fixed an issue where branches of the tree would sometimes overlap.

### Other

 - `igraph_degree_sequence_game()`: improved performance with `IGRAPH_DEGSEQ_SIMPLE_NO_MULTIPLE_UNIFORM` method.
 - Improved the robustness of the test suite.
 - Documentation improvements.
 - Improved error and warning messages.
 - Improved compatibility with recent versions of Microsoft Visual C.

## [0.8.2] - 2020-04-28

 - Improved argument checking: `igraph_all_st_mincuts()` and `igraph_sir()`
 - Improved interruptibility: `igraph_sir()`

### Fixed

 - `igraph_community_leiden()`: fixed crash when interrupting
