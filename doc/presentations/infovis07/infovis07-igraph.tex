%% \section{Goals}
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Ability to handle large graphs efficiently.
%% \item Embeddable into higher level environments like GNU R or Python.
%% \item Ability to be used for quick prototyping.
%% \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Features}

\begin{itemize}
\item Efficient implementation. The current state of the art
  algorithms are implemented (if not that is considered as a bug).
\item Portable C (and some C++) code, works on most platforms:
  Linux flavours, MS Windows variations, Mac OSX, Solaris, etc.
\item Wide variety of graph algorithms: random and regular graph
  structures, centrality measures, shortest paths, 2D and 3D graph
  layouts, graph motifs, cliques, network flows and cuts, community
  structure detection, etc.
\item Interfaces from GNU R and Python, other interfaces can be added
  without too much hassle.
\item Interactive and non-interactive, 2D and 3D
  visualization from R and Python.
\item Graph, vertex and edge attributes, like edge weights, vertex
  colors and other parameters for plotting.
\item Various import and export file formats: GraphML, Pajek, simple
  edge list, etc.
\item Well documented.
\item Open source and completely free for non-commercial and
  commercial use.
\end{itemize}

\section{Architecture}

Simple and flexible layered architecture.
Modules interact via well-defined interfaces and 
can be replaced individually without breaking other parts.
