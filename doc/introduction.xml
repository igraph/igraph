<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
This is another library for creating and manipulating graphs.
You can look at it two ways: first, igraph contains the implementation
of quite a lot graph algorithms. These include classic graph
algorithms like graph isomorphism, graph girth and connectivity and
also the new wave graph algorithms like transitivity, graph motifs and 
community structure detection. Skim through the table of contents
or the index of this book to get an impression.</para>

<para>
Second, igraph provides a platform for the developing and/or
implementing graph algorithms. It has a quite efficient data structure
for representing graphs and a number of other data structures like
flexible vectors, stacks, heaps, queues, adjacency lists to accomplish
this. In fact these data structures evolved along the
implementation of the classic and non-classic graph algorithms which
make up the major part of the igraph library. This way they were fine tuned
and checked for correctness several times.
</para>

<para>
Our main goal with developing igraph was to create a graph library
which is efficient on large but not extremely large graphs. More
precisely, it is assumed that the graph(s) fit into the physical
memory of the computer. Nowadays this means graphs with
several million vertices and/or edges. Our definition of efficient is
that it runs fast, both in theory and (more importantly) in practice.
</para>

<para>
We believe that one of the big strengths of igraph is that it can be
embedded into a higher level language or environment. Two such
embeddings (or interfaces if you look at them the other way)
are currently being developed by us: igraph as a GNU R
package and igraph as a Python extension module. A third embedding,
being developed by another developer is a Ruby extension. Other are
likely to come. The high level languages as R or Python make it
possible to do use graph routines with mush greater comfort, without
actually writing a single line of C code. They have some, usually very
small, speed penalty compared to the C version, but add ease and much
flexibility. This manual however covers only the C library. If you 
want to use Python or GNU R, please see the documentation written
specifically for these interfaces and come back here only if you're
interested in some detail which is not covered in those documents.
</para>

<para>
We still consider igraph as a child project. It has much room for
development and we are sure that it will improve a lot in the near
future. Any feedback we can get from the users is very important for
us, as most of the time these questions and comments guide us in what
to add and what to improve.
</para>

<para>
igraph is open source and distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL.
We strongly believe that all the algorithms used in science, let that
be graph theory or not, should have an efficient open source
implementation allowing use and modification for anyone.
