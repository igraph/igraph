<para>
  The igraph library is considered thread-safe on platforms that 
  support thread-local storage. This currently includes Linux and MS
  Windows operating systems, but not Mac OSX. The best way to check 
  whether an igraph build is thread-safe is checking the 
  <link linkend="IGRAPH_THREAD_SAFE">
    <function>IGRAPH_THREAD_SAFE</function>
  </link> macro.

<para>
Note that igraph is only thread-safe if it was built with the internal
ARPACK library, i.e. the one that comes with igraph. The standard
ARPACK library is not thread-safe.
