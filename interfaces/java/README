igraph library Java interface
=============================

Preface
-------

__ATTENTION__: This is a highly experimental, proof-of-concept Java interface.
Its main purpose was to convince me that it can be done in finite time :)
The interface is highly incomplete, at the time of writing even some
essential functions (e.g. `addEdges`) are missing. Since I don't use Java
intensively, chances are that this interface gets finished only if there
is substantial demand for it and/or someone takes the time to send patches
or finish it completely.

Requirements
------------

In order to compile the Java interface from scratch, you'll need the
following:

* A recent C compiler

* A recent Java SDK (>= 1.3 should be enough, but I only tried 1.5)

* Python 2.4 or later if you want to use the interface generator called
  Stimulus (found in tools/stimulus.py in the igraph distribution) to
  generate `src/Graph.java` and `src/hu_kfki_rmki_cneuro_igraph_Graph.c`

* A GNU-compatible environment (e.g. Cygwin or MinGW on Windows,
  practically anything on Linux, XCode Developer Tools on Mac OS X)

Compilation steps
-----------------

First, compile and install the C core of igraph (see the corresponding
[documentation](http://cneurocvs.rmki.kfki.hu/igraph). After that,
do the usual `./configure && make` cycle in order to compile the Java
interface. This should generate two files in the `build/` subdirectory:

* `igraph-0.5.jar` (substitute the appropriate version number of course).
  This contains the platform-independent compiled class files. Put it
  wherever you want in your classpath.
    
* `igraph-java-wrapper.dll` on Windows, `libigraph-java-wrapper.so` on
  Linux or `igraph-java-wrapper.jnilib` on Mac OS X. This contains the
  platform-dependent parts. Put it somewhere in the Java library path
  so Java can find it. (The library path can be determined by
  `System.out.println(System.getProperty("java.library.path"))` from
  Java. If you want to keep it elsewhere, you can alter the library
  path by passing `-Djava.library.path=whatever` to the Java
  interpreter when executing an igraph-based program.
  
`./configure` might fail stating that igraph is not installed on your
system. In that case, you must specify explicitly where igraph is
to be found by using `./configure --with-igraph=whatever`. E.g., if
you installed the igraph libraries in `/opt/igraph/lib` and the
igraph include files in `/opt/igraph/include`, you must use
`./configure --with-igraph=/opt/igraph`. On Linux and OS X, the
configure script will try to determine the igraph path by using
`pkg-config` (if you installed that).

In case `./configure` does not find your Java interpreter, you should
put or symlink it to somewhere in your shell path (igraph needs
access to `java`, `javac`, `javah` and `jar`), or set the `JAVA_HOME`
environment variable to the appropriate directory.

me also if you find this a great idea and want to complete it for
the benefit of the whole open source community :)
