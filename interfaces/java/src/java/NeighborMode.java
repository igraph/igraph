/*

ATTENTION: This is a highly experimental, proof-of-concept Java interface.
Its main purpose was to convince me that it can be done in finite time :)
The interface is highly incomplete, at the time of writing even some
essential functions (e.g. addEdges) are missing. Since I don't use Java
intensively, chances are that this interface gets finished only if there
is substantial demand for it and/or someone takes the time to send patches
or finish it completely.
