"""
Drawing and plotting routines for IGraph.

Plotting is dependent on the C{pycairo} library which provides Python bindings
to the popular U{Cairo library<http://www.cairographics.org>}. This means that
if you don't have U{pycairo<http://www.cairographics.org/pycairo>} installed,
you won't be able to use the plotting capabilities. However, you can still use
L{Graph.write_svg} to save the graph to an SVG file and view it from
U{Mozilla Firefox<http://www.mozilla.org/firefox>} (free) or edit it in
U{Inkscape<http://www.inkscape.org>} (free), U{Skencil<http://www.skencil.org>}
(formerly known as Sketch, also free) or Adobe Illustrator (not free, therefore
I'm not linking to it :)).

class Plot(object):
    """Class representing an arbitrary plot

    Every plot has an associated surface object where the plotting is done. The
    surface is an instance of C{cairo.Surface}, a member of the C{pycairo}
    library. The surface itself provides a unified API to various plotting
    targets like SVG files, X11 windows, PostScript files, PNG files and so on.
    C{igraph} usually does not know on which surface it is plotting right now,
    since C{pycairo} takes care of the actual drawing. Everything that's supported
    by C{pycairo} should be supported by this class as well.

    Current Cairo surfaces that I'm aware of are:

      - C{cairo.GlitzSurface} -- OpenGL accelerated surface for the X11
        Window System.

      - C{cairo.ImageSurface} -- memory buffer surface. Can be written to a
        C{PNG} image file.

      - C{cairo.PdfSurface} -- PDF document surface.

      - C{cairo.PsSurface} -- PostScript document surface.

      - C{cairo.Win32Surface} -- Microsoft Windows screen rendering.

      - C{cairo.XlibSurface} -- X11 Window System screen rendering.

    If you create a C{Plot} object with a string given as the target surface,
    the string will be treated as a filename, and its extension will decide
    which surface class will be used. Please note that not all surfaces might
    be available, depending on your C{pycairo} installation.

    A C{Plot} has an assigned default palette (see L{igraph.drawing.colors.Palette})
    which is used for plotting objects.

    A C{Plot} object also has a list of objects to be plotted with their
    respective bounding boxes, palettes and opacities. Palettes assigned
    to an object override the default palette of the plot. Objects can be
    added by the L{Plot.add} method and removed by the L{Plot.remove} method.

      (in pixels for PNG images and on-screen plots, or in points for PDF,
      SVG and PostScript plots, where 72 pt = 1 inch = 2.54 cm). If this is
      a tuple with four integers, the first two denotes the X and Y coordinates

    @keyword opacity: the opacity of the object being plotted. It can be

      layout for them -- for instance, you might plot a graph with opacity
      0.5 and then plot its spanning tree over it with opacity 0.1. To
      achieve this, you'll need to modify the L{Plot} object returned with
      L{Plot.add}.

      an L{igraph.drawing.colors.Palette} object or a string referring
      to a valid key of C{igraph.drawing.colors.palettes} (see module
