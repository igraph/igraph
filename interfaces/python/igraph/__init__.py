class Graph(GraphBase):
    """Generic graph.
    
    This class is built on top of L{GraphBase}, so the order of the
    methods in the Epydoc documentation is a little bit obscure:
    inherited methods come after the ones implemented directly in the
    subclass. L{Graph} provides many functions that L{GraphBase} does not,
    mostly because these functions are not speed critical and they were
    easier to implement in Python than in pure C. An example is the
    attribute handling in the constructor: the constructor of L{Graph}
    accepts three dictionaries corresponding to the graph, vertex and edge
    attributes while the constructor of L{GraphBase} does not. This extension
    was needed to make L{Graph} serializable through the C{pickle} module.
    L{Graph} also overrides some functions from L{GraphBase} to provide a
    more convenient interface; e.g., layout functions return a L{Layout}
    instance from L{Graph} instead of a list of coordinate pairs.

    Graphs can also be indexed by strings or pairs of vertex indices or vertex
    names.  When a graph is indexed by a string, the operation translates to
    the retrieval, creation, modification or deletion of a graph attribute:

      >>> g = Graph.Full(3)
      >>> g["name"] = "Triangle graph"
      >>> g["name"]
      'Triangle graph'
      >>> del g["name"]

    When a graph is indexed by a pair of vertex indices or names, the graph
    itself is treated as an adjacency matrix and the corresponding cell of
    the matrix is returned:

      >>> g = Graph.Full(3)
      >>> g.vs["name"] = ["A", "B", "C"]
      >>> g[1, 2]
      1
      >>> g["A", "B"]
      1
      >>> g["A", "B"] = 0
      >>> g.ecount()
      2
    
    Assigning values different from zero or one to the adjacency matrix will
    be translated to one, unless the graph is weighted, in which case the
    numbers will be treated as weights:

      >>> g.is_weighted()
      False
      >>> g["A", "B"] = 2
      >>> g["A", "B"]
      1
      >>> g.es["weight"] = 1.0
      >>> g.is_weighted()
      True
      >>> g["A", "B"] = 2
      >>> g["A", "B"]
      2
      >>> g.es["weight"]

             used. It may either be a L{Layout} instance, a list of
             coordinate pairs, the name of a layout function, or a

             with the graph as a parameter.

          2. Otherwise, if the graph has vertex attributes called C{x}
             and C{y}, these will be used as coordinates in the layout.
             When a 3D layout is requested (by setting C{dim} to 3),
             a vertex attribute named C{z} will also be needed.

          3. Otherwise, if the graph is connected and has at most 100
             vertices, the Kamada-Kawai layout will be used (see
             L{Graph.layout_kamada_kawai()}).

             Fruchterman-Reingold layout will be used (see
             L{Graph.layout_fruchterman_reingold()}).

          5. If everything else above failed, the DrL layout algorithm

        Places the vertices using a layered Sugiyama layout.

        This is a layered layout that is most suitable for directed acyclic graphs,
        although it works on undirected or cyclic graphs as well.

        Each vertex is assigned to a layer and each layer is placed on a horizontal
        line. Vertices within the same layer are then permuted using the barycenter
        heuristic that tries to minimize edge crossings.

        Dummy vertices will be added on edges that span more than one layer. The
        returned layout therefore contains more rows than the number of nodes in
        the original graph; the extra rows correspond to the dummy vertices.

        @param layers: a vector specifying a non-negative integer layer index for
          each vertex, or the name of a numeric vertex attribute that contains
          the layer indices. If C{None}, a layering will be determined
          automatically. For undirected graphs, a spanning tree will be extracted
          and vertices will be assigned to layers using a breadth first search from
          the node with the largest degree. For directed graphs, cycles are broken
          by reversing the direction of edges in an approximate feedback arc set
          using the heuristic of Eades, Lin and Smyth, and then using longest path
          layering to place the vertices in layers.
        @param weights: edge weights to be used. Can be a sequence or iterable or
          even an edge attribute name.
        @param hgap: minimum horizontal gap between vertices in the same layer.
        @param vgap: vertical gap between layers. The layer index will be
          multiplied by I{vgap} to obtain the Y coordinate.
        @param maxiter: maximum number of iterations to take in the crossing
          reduction step. Increase this if you feel that you are getting too many
          edge crossings.
        @param return_extended_graph: specifies that the extended graph with the
          added dummy vertices should also be returned. When this is C{True}, the
          result will be a tuple containing the layout and the extended graph. The
          first |V| nodes of the extended graph will correspond to the nodes of the
          original graph, the remaining ones are dummy nodes. Plotting the extended
          graph with the returned layout and hidden dummy nodes will produce a layout
          that is similar to the original graph, but with the added edge bends.
          The extended graph also contains an edge attribute called C{_original_eid}
          which specifies the ID of the edge in the original graph from which the
          edge of the extended graph was created.
        @return: the calculated layout, which may (and usually will) have more rows
          than the number of vertices; the remaining rows correspond to the dummy
          nodes introduced in the layering step. When C{return_extended_graph} is
          C{True}, it will also contain the extended graph.

        The visual style of vertices and edges can be modified at three
        places in the following order of precedence (lower indices override
        higher indices):

          1. Keyword arguments of this function (or of L{plot()} which is
             passed intact to C{Graph.__plot__()}.

          2. Vertex or edge attributes, specified later in the list of
             keyword arguments.

          3. igraph-wide plotting defaults (see
             L{igraph.config.Configuration})

          4. Built-in defaults.

        E.g., if the C{vertex_size} keyword attribute is not present,
        but there exists a vertex attribute named C{size}, the sizes of
        the vertices will be specified by that attribute.

        Besides the usual self-explanatory plotting parameters (C{context},
        C{bbox}, C{palette}), it accepts the following keyword arguments:

          - C{autocurve}: whether to use curves instead of straight lines for
            multiple edges on the graph plot. This argument may be C{True}
            or C{False}; when omitted, C{True} is assumed for graphs with
            less than 10.000 edges and C{False} otherwise.

          - C{drawer_factory}: a subclass of L{AbstractCairoGraphDrawer}
            which will be used to draw the graph. You may also provide
            a function here which takes two arguments: the Cairo context
            to draw on and a bounding box (an instance of L{BoundingBox}).
            If this keyword argument is missing, igraph will use the
            default graph drawer which should be suitable for most purposes.
            It is safe to omit this keyword argument unless you need to use
            a specific graph drawer.

          - C{keep_aspect_ratio}: whether to keep the aspect ratio of the layout
            that igraph calculates to place the nodes. C{True} means that the
            layout will be scaled proportionally to fit into the bounding box
            where the graph is to be drawn but the aspect ratio will be kept
            the same (potentially leaving empty space next to, below or above
            the graph). C{False} means that the layout will be scaled independently
            along the X and Y axis in order to fill the entire bounding box.
            The default is C{False}.

          - C{layout}: the layout to be used. If not an instance of
            L{Layout}, it will be passed to L{Graph.layout} to calculate
            the layout. Note that if you want a deterministic layout that
            does not change with every plot, you must either use a
            deterministic layout function (like L{Graph.layout_circle}) or
            calculate the layout in advance and pass a L{Layout} object here.
            
          - C{margin}: the top, right, bottom, left margins as a 4-tuple.
            If it has less than 4 elements or is a single float, the elements
            will be re-used until the length is at least 4.

          - C{mark_groups}: whether to highlight some of the vertex groups by
            colored polygons. This argument can be one of the following:
            
              - C{False}: no groups will be highlighted

              - A dict mapping tuples of vertex indices to color names.
                The given vertex groups will be highlighted by the given
                colors.

              - A list containing pairs or an iterable yielding pairs, where
              the first element of each pair is a list of vertex indices and
              the second element is a color.

            In place of lists of vertex indices, you may also use L{VertexSeq}
            instances.

            In place of color names, you may also use color indices into the
            current palette. C{None} as a color name will mean that the
            corresponding group is ignored.

          - C{vertex_size}: size of the vertices. The corresponding vertex
            attribute is called C{size}. The default is 10. Vertex sizes
            are measured in the unit of the Cairo context on which igraph
            is drawing.

          - C{vertex_color}: color of the vertices. The corresponding vertex
            attribute is C{color}, the default is red.  Colors can be
            specified either by common X11 color names (see the source
            code of L{igraph.drawing.colors} for a list of known colors), by
            3-tuples of floats (ranging between 0 and 255 for the R, G and
            B components), by CSS-style string specifications (C{#rrggbb})
            or by integer color indices of the specified palette.

          - C{vertex_frame_color}: color of the frame (i.e. stroke) of the
            vertices. The corresponding vertex attribute is C{frame_color},
            the default is black. See C{vertex_color} for the possible ways
            of specifying a color.

          - C{vertex_frame_width}: the width of the frame (i.e. stroke) of the
            vertices. The corresponding vertex attribute is C{frame_width}.
            The default is 1. Vertex frame widths are measured in the unit of the
            Cairo context on which igraph is drawing.

          - C{vertex_shape}: shape of the vertices. Alternatively it can
            be specified by the C{shape} vertex attribute. Possibilities
            are: C{square}, {circle}, {triangle}, {triangle-down} or
            C{hidden}. See the source code of L{igraph.drawing} for a
            list of alternative shape names that are also accepted and
            mapped to these.

          - C{vertex_label}: labels drawn next to the vertices.
            The corresponding vertex attribute is C{label}.

          - C{vertex_label_dist}: distance of the midpoint of the vertex
            label from the center of the corresponding vertex.
            The corresponding vertex attribute is C{label_dist}.

          - C{vertex_label_color}: color of the label. Corresponding
            vertex attribute: C{label_color}. See C{vertex_color} for
            color specification syntax.

          - C{vertex_label_size}: font size of the label, specified
            in the unit of the Cairo context on which we are drawing.
            Corresponding vertex attribute: C{label_size}.

          - C{vertex_label_angle}: the direction of the line connecting
            the midpoint of the vertex with the midpoint of the label.
            This can be used to position the labels relative to the
            vertices themselves in conjunction with C{vertex_label_dist}.
            Corresponding vertex attribute: C{label_angle}. The
            default is C{-math.pi/2}.

          - C{vertex_order}: drawing order of the vertices. This must be
            a list or tuple containing vertex indices; vertices are then
            drawn according to this order.

          - C{vertex_order_by}: an alternative way to specify the drawing
            order of the vertices; this attribute is interpreted as the name
            of a vertex attribute, and vertices are drawn such that those
            with a smaller attribute value are drawn first. You may also
            reverse the order by passing a tuple here; the first element of
            the tuple should be the name of the attribute, the second element
            specifies whether the order is reversed (C{True}, C{False},
            C{"asc"} and C{"desc"} are accepted values).

          - C{edge_color}: color of the edges. The corresponding edge
            attribute is C{color}, the default is red. See C{vertex_color}
            for color specification syntax.

          - C{edge_curved}: whether the edges should be curved. Positive
            numbers correspond to edges curved in a counter-clockwise
            direction, negative numbers correspond to edges curved in a
            clockwise direction. Zero represents straight edges. C{True}
            is interpreted as 0.5, C{False} is interpreted as 0. The
            default is 0 which makes all the edges straight.

          - C{edge_width}: width of the edges in the default unit of the

            drawn according to this order.

          - C{edge_order_by}: an alternative way to specify the drawing
            order of the edges; this attribute is interpreted as the name
            of an edge attribute, and edges are drawn such that those

class VertexSeq(_igraph.VertexSeq):
    """Class representing a sequence of vertices in the graph.
    
    This class is most easily accessed by the C{vs} field of the
    L{Graph} object, which returns an ordered sequence of all vertices in
    the graph. The vertex sequence can be refined by invoking the
    L{VertexSeq.select()} method. L{VertexSeq.select()} can also be
    accessed by simply calling the L{VertexSeq} object.

    An alternative way to create a vertex sequence referring to a given
    graph is to use the constructor directly:
    
      >>> g = Graph.Full(3)
      >>> vs = VertexSeq(g)
      >>> restricted_vs = VertexSeq(g, [0, 1])

    The individual vertices can be accessed by indexing the vertex sequence
    object. It can be used as an iterable as well, or even in a list
    comprehension:
    
      >>> g=Graph.Full(3)
      >>> for v in g.vs:
      ...   v["value"] = v.index ** 2
      ...
      >>> [v["value"] ** 0.5 for v in g.vs]
      [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]
      
    The vertex set can also be used as a dictionary where the keys are the
    attribute names. The values corresponding to the keys are the values
    of the given attribute for every vertex selected by the sequence.
    
      >>> g=Graph.Full(3)
      >>> for idx, v in enumerate(g.vs):
      ...   v["weight"] = idx*(idx+1)
      ...
      >>> g.vs["weight"]
      [0, 2, 6]
      >>> g.vs.select(1,2)["weight"] = [10, 20]
      >>> g.vs["weight"]
      [0, 10, 20]

    If you specify a sequence that is shorter than the number of vertices in
    the VertexSeq, the sequence is reused:

      >>> g = Graph.Tree(7, 2)
      >>> g.vs["color"] = ["red", "green"]
      >>> g.vs["color"]
      ['red', 'green', 'red', 'green', 'red', 'green', 'red']

    You can even pass a single string or integer, it will be considered as a
    sequence of length 1:

      >>> g.vs["color"] = "red"
      >>> g.vs["color"]
      ['red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'red']

    Some methods of the vertex sequences are simply proxy methods to the
    corresponding methods in the L{Graph} object. One such example is
    L{VertexSeq.degree()}:

      >>> g=Graph.Tree(7, 2)
      >>> g.vs.degree()
      [2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1]
      >>> g.vs.degree() == g.degree()

        The selection criteria can be specified by the positional and the keyword

        arguments.
        
          - If the first positional argument is C{None}, an empty sequence is
            returned.

            will be called for every vertex in the sequence. If it returns
            C{True}, the vertex will be included, otherwise it will
            be excluded.
            
          - If the first positional argument is an iterable, it must return
            integers and they will be considered as indices of the current
            vertex set (NOT the whole vertex set of the graph -- the
            difference matters when one filters a vertex set that has
            already been filtered by a previous invocation of
            L{VertexSeq.select()}. In this case, the indices do not refer
            directly to the vertices of the graph but to the elements of
            the filtered vertex sequence.
            
          - If the first positional argument is an integer, all remaining
            arguments are expected to be integers. They are considered as
            indices of the current vertex set again.

        Keyword arguments can be used to filter the vertices based on their
        attributes. The name of the keyword specifies the name of the attribute
        and the filtering operator, they should be concatenated by an
        underscore (C{_}) character. Attribute names can also contain
        underscores, but operator names don't, so the operator is always the
        largest trailing substring of the keyword name that does not contain
        an underscore. Possible operators are:

          - C{eq}: equal to

          - C{ne}: not equal to

          - C{lt}: less than
          
          - C{gt}: greater than

          - C{le}: less than or equal to

          - C{ge}: greater than or equal to

          - C{in}: checks if the value of an attribute is in a given list

          - C{notin}: checks if the value of an attribute is not in a given
            list

        For instance, if you want to filter vertices with a numeric C{age}
        property larger than 200, you have to write:

          >>> g.vs.select(age_gt=200)                   #doctest: +SKIP

        Similarly, to filter vertices whose C{type} is in a list of predefined
        types:

          >>> list_of_types = ["HR", "Finance", "Management"]
          >>> g.vs.select(type_in=list_of_types)        #doctest: +SKIP

        If the operator is omitted, it defaults to C{eq}. For instance, the
        following selector selects vertices whose C{cluster} property equals
        to 2:

          >>> g.vs.select(cluster=2)                    #doctest: +SKIP

        In the case of an unknown operator, it is assumed that the
        recognized operator is part of the attribute name and the actual
        operator is C{eq}.

        Attribute names inferred from keyword arguments are treated specially
        if they start with an underscore (C{_}). These are not real attributes
        but refer to specific properties of the vertices, e.g., its degree.
        The rule is as follows: if an attribute name starts with an underscore,
        the rest of the name is interpreted as a method of the L{Graph} object.
        This method is called with the vertex sequence as its first argument
        (all others left at default values) and vertices are filtered
        according to the value returned by the method. For instance, if you
        want to exclude isolated vertices:

          >>> g = Graph.Famous("zachary")
          >>> non_isolated = g.vs.select(_degree_gt=0)

        For properties that take a long time to be computed (e.g., betweenness
        centrality for large graphs), it is advised to calculate the values
        in advance and store it in a graph attribute. The same applies when
        you are selecting based on the same property more than once in the
        same C{select()} call to avoid calculating it twice unnecessarily.
        For instance, the following would calculate betweenness centralities
        twice:

          >>> edges = g.vs.select(_betweenness_gt=10, _betweenness_lt=30)

        It is advised to use this instead:

          >>> g.vs["bs"] = g.betweenness()
          >>> edges = g.vs.select(bs_gt=10, bs_lt=30)

            will be called for every edge in the sequence. If it returns
            C{True}, the edge will be included, otherwise it will
            be excluded.
            
          - If the first positional argument is an iterable, it must return
            integers and they will be considered as indices of the current
            edge set (NOT the whole edge set of the graph -- the
            difference matters when one filters an edge set that has
            already been filtered by a previous invocation of
            L{EdgeSeq.select()}. In this case, the indices do not refer
            directly to the edges of the graph but to the elements of
            the filtered edge sequence.
            
          - If the first positional argument is an integer, all remaining
            arguments are expected to be integers. They are considered as
            indices of the current edge set again.

        Keyword arguments can be used to filter the edges based on their
        attributes and properties. The name of the keyword specifies the name
        of the attribute and the filtering operator, they should be
        concatenated by an underscore (C{_}) character. Attribute names can
        also contain underscores, but operator names don't, so the operator is
        always the largest trailing substring of the keyword name that does not
        contain an underscore. Possible operators are:

          - C{eq}: equal to

          - C{ne}: not equal to

          - C{lt}: less than
          
          - C{gt}: greater than

          - C{le}: less than or equal to

          - C{ge}: greater than or equal to

          - C{in}: checks if the value of an attribute is in a given list

          - C{notin}: checks if the value of an attribute is not in a given
            list

        For instance, if you want to filter edges with a numeric C{weight}
        property larger than 50, you have to write:

          >>> g.es.select(weight_gt=50)            #doctest: +SKIP

        Similarly, to filter edges whose C{type} is in a list of predefined
        types:

          >>> list_of_types = ["inhibitory", "excitatory"]
          >>> g.es.select(type_in=list_of_types)   #doctest: +SKIP

        If the operator is omitted, it defaults to C{eq}. For instance, the
        following selector selects edges whose C{type} property is
        C{intracluster}:

          >>> g.es.select(type="intracluster")     #doctest: +SKIP

        In the case of an unknown operator, it is assumed that the
        recognized operator is part of the attribute name and the actual
        operator is C{eq}.

        Keyword arguments are treated specially if they start with an
        underscore (C{_}). These are not real attributes but refer to specific
        properties of the edges, e.g., their centrality.  The rules are as
        follows:

          1. C{_source} or {_from} means the source vertex of an edge.

          2. C{_target} or {_to} means the target vertex of an edge.

          3. C{_within} ignores the operator and checks whether both endpoints
             of the edge lie within a specified set.

          4. C{_between} ignores the operator and checks whether I{one}
             endpoint of the edge lies within a specified set and the I{other}
             endpoint lies within another specified set. The two sets must be
             given as a tuple.

          5. Otherwise, the rest of the name is interpreted as a method of the
             L{Graph} object. This method is called with the edge sequence as
             its first argument (all others left at default values) and edges
             are filtered according to the value returned by the method.
             
        For instance, if you want to exclude edges with a betweenness
        centrality less than 2:

          >>> g = Graph.Famous("zachary")
          >>> excl = g.es.select(_edge_betweenness_ge = 2)

        To select edges originating from vertices 2 and 4:

          >>> edges = g.es.select(_source_in = [2, 4]) 

        To select edges lying entirely within the subgraph spanned by vertices
        2, 3, 4 and 7:

          >>> edges = g.es.select(_within = [2, 3, 4, 7])

        To select edges with one endpoint in the vertex set containing vertices
        2, 3, 4 and 7 and the other endpoint in the vertex set containing
        vertices 8 and 9:

          >>> edges = g.es.select(_between = ([2, 3, 4, 7], [8, 9]))

        For properties that take a long time to be computed (e.g., betweenness
        centrality for large graphs), it is advised to calculate the values
        in advance and store it in a graph attribute. The same applies when
        you are selecting based on the same property more than once in the
        same C{select()} call to avoid calculating it twice unnecessarily.
        For instance, the following would calculate betweenness centralities
        twice:

          >>> edges = g.es.select(_edge_betweenness_gt=10,       # doctest:+SKIP
          ...                     _edge_betweenness_lt=30)

        It is advised to use this instead:

          >>> g.es["bs"] = g.edge_betweenness()
          >>> edges = g.es.select(bs_gt=10, bs_lt=30)
