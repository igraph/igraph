A pre-compiled version is available for macOS users.

Installing on other operating systems requires a
working ``gcc`` or ``clang`` compiler.

Using Docker
------------

There are currently two Docker images available on `Docker Hub`_.

- ``mapequation/infomap``

The image ``mapequation/infomap`` can be started with

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -it --rm \
        -v `pwd`:/data \
        mapequation/infomap
        [infomap arguments]

You can also use the supplied `docker-compose.yml`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose run --rm infomap

The image ``mapequation/infomap:notebook`` can be started with

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run \
        -v `pwd`:/home/jovyan/work \
        -p 8888:8888 \
        mapequation/infomap:notebook \
        start.sh jupyter lab

Or similarly, using docker-compose:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose up notebook

.. _`Docker Hub`: https://hub.docker.com/r/mapequation/infomap
.. _`docker-compose.yml`: https://github.com/mapequation/infomap/blob/master/docker-compose.yml
