The GLPK package is a set of routines written in ANSI C and organized
in the form of a callable library. This package is intended for solving
large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer linear programming
(MIP), and other related problems.

The GLPK package includes the following main components:

* primal simplex method;
* dual simplex method;
* exact simplex method based on rational arithmetic;
* primal-dual interior-point method;
* branch-and-cut method;
* application program interface (API);
* GNU MathProg modeling language (a subset of AMPL);
* GLPSOL (stand-alone LP/MIP solver).
