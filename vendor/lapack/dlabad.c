         SUBROUTINE DLABAD( SMALL, LARGE )   

         DOUBLE PRECISION   LARGE, SMALL   


   > \par Purpose:   
    =============   
   >   
   > \verbatim   
   >   
   > DLABAD takes as input the values computed by DLAMCH for underflow and   
   > overflow, and returns the square root of each of these values if the   
   > log of LARGE is sufficiently large.  This subroutine is intended to   
   > identify machines with a large exponent range, such as the Crays, and   
   > redefine the underflow and overflow limits to be the square roots of   
   > the values computed by DLAMCH.  This subroutine is needed because   
   > DLAMCH does not compensate for poor arithmetic in the upper half of   
   > the exponent range, as is found on a Cray.   
   > \endverbatim

   >          root of SMALL, otherwise unchanged.
