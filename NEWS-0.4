New in the C library
--------------------

* internal representation changed
* neighbors always returns an ordered list
* igraph_is_loop and igraph_is_multiple added

* topological sorting
* VF2 isomorphism algorithm
* support for reading the file format of the Graph Database for isomorphism
* igraph_mincut cat calculate the actual minimum cut
* girth calculation added, thanks to Keith Briggs
* support for reading and writing GML files

* Walktrap community detection algorithm added, thanks to Matthieu Latapy 
  and Pascal Pons
* edge betweenness based community detection algorithm added
* fast greedy algorithm for community detection by Clauset et al. added
  thanks to Aaron Clauset for sharing his code
* leading eigenvector community detection algorithm by Mark Newman added
* igraph_community_to_membership supporting function added, creates 
  a membership vector from a community structure merge tree
* modularity calculation added

New in the R interface
----------------------

* as the internal representation changed, graphs stored with 'save' 
  with an older igraph version cannot be read back with the new
  version reliably.
* neighbors returns ordered lists

* topological sorting
* VF2 isomorphism algorithm
* support for reading graphs from the Graph Database for isomorphism
* girth calculation added, thanks to Keith Briggs
* support for reading and writing GML files

* Walktrap community detection algorithm added, thanks to Matthieu Latapy 
  and Pascal Pons
* edge betweenness based community detection algorithm added
* fast greedy algorithm for community detection by Clauset et al. added
  thanks to Aaron Clauset for sharing his code  
* leading eigenvector community detection algorithm by Mark Newman added
* functions for creating denrdograms from the output of the 
  community detection algorithms added
* community.membership supporting function added, creates 
  a membership vector from a community structure merge tree
* modularity calculation added

* graphics parameter handling is completely rewritten, uniform handling 
  of colors and fonts, make sure you read ?igraph.plotting
* new plotting parameter for edges: arrow.mode
* a bug corrected when playing a nonlinear barabasi.game
* better looking plotting in 3d using rglplot: edges are 3d too
* rglplot layout is allowed to be two dimensional now
* rglplot suspends updates while drawing, this makes it faster
* loop edges are correctly plotted by all three plotting functions

* better printing of attributes when printing graphs
* summary of a graph prints attribute names
* is.igraph rewritten to make it possible to inherit from the 'igraph' class
* somewhat better looking progress meter for functions which support it

Others
------

* proper support for Debian packages (re)added
* many functions benefit from the new internal representation and are 
  faster now: transitivity, reciprocity, graph operator functions like 
  intersection and union, etc.
* igraph compiles with Microsoft Visual C++ now
* there were some internal changes to make igraph a real graph algorithm
  platform in the near future, but these are undocumented now

Bugs corrected
--------------

* corrected a bug when reading Pajek files: directed graphs were read as undirected
