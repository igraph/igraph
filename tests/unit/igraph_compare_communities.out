Only one member, both partitions equal to whole set:
VI result: 0
Rand result: failed as expected
Adjusted Rand result: failed as expected
NMI result: 1
Split-join result: 0

Empty sets:
VI result: 0
Rand result: failed as expected
Adjusted Rand result: failed as expected
NMI result: 1
Split-join result: 0

Two equal, differenly labeled partitions:
VI result: 0
Rand result: 1
Adjusted Rand result: NaN
NMI result: 1
Split-join result: 0

Two different partitions: ((5,1), (8,3,4), (0,6,7,2,9)) and ((5,8), (1,3,4,0), (6,7,2,9))
