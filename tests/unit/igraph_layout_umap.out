layout of two clusters of vertices with 2 articulation points:
UMAP layout seems fine.
same graph, different negative sampling probability:
UMAP layout seems fine.
same graph, different epochs:
UMAP layout seems fine.
Same graph, no weights:
UMAP layout seems fine.
Empty graph:
Check error for negative min_dist.
Check error for negative epochs.
