No vertices:
( )

one vertex, empty subset:
( 0 )

Graph with unconnected vertices, loops and multiple edges, empty subsets:
( 0 0 0 0 0 0 )

Same graph, every vertex as a subset:
( 0 1 0 0 0 0 )

Same graph, every vertex and next one as a subset:
( 2 1 1 2 0 0 )

Same situation, but with weights:
( 0 0.1 0.4 1.1 0 0 )

Same situation, no weights, but undirected graph:
( 2 1 1 2 0 0 )

Same graph, whole graph as subset:
( 8 )
