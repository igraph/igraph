Demonstration of difference in assortativities of graphs with the same degree sequence but different linkages:

Initial graph based on the Barabasi-Albert model with 500 nodes.
Assortativity of initial graph = -0.171365

Assortativity after choosing vertices with the smallest degrees first = -0.262756

Assortativity after choosing vertices with the largest degrees first = 0.366441
