Demonstration of difference in assortativities of graphs with the same degree sequence but different linkages:

Initial graph based on the Barabasi-Albert model with 500 nodes.
Assortativity of initial graph = -0.139696

Assortativity after choosing vertices with the smallest degrees first = -0.210028

Assortativity after choosing vertices with the largest degrees first = 0.113719
