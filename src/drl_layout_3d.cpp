// In this version, the simulated shared memory is spread among all processors
//
// The structure of the inputs and outputs of this code will be displayed
// if the program is called without parameters, or if an erroneous
// parameter is passed to the program.

 * \function igraph_layout_drl_3d
 * The DrL layout generator, 3d version.
 *
 * This function implements the force-directed DrL layout generator.
 * Please see more in the technical report: Martin, S., Brown, W.M.,
 * Klavans, R., Boyack, K.W., DrL: Distributed Recursive (Graph)
 * Layout. SAND Reports, 2008. 2936: p. 1-10.
 *
 * </para><para> This function uses a modified DrL generator that does
 * the layout in three dimensions.
 * \param graph The input graph.
 * \param use_seed Logical scalar, if true, then the coordinates
 *    supplied in the \p res argument are used as starting points.
 * \param res Pointer to a matrix, the result layout is stored
 *    here. It will be resized as needed.
 * \param options The parameters to pass to the layout generator.
 * \param weights Edge weights, pointer to a vector. If this is a null
 *    pointer then every edge will have the same weight.
 * \param fixed Pointer to a logical vector, or a null pointer. This
 *    can be used to fix the position of some vertices. Vertices for
 *    which it is true will not be moved, but stay at the coordinates
 *    given in the \p res matrix. This argument is ignored if it is a
 *    null pointer or if use_seed is false.
 * \return Error code.
 *
 * Time complexity: ???.
 *
 * \sa \ref igraph_layout_drl() for the standard 2d version.
