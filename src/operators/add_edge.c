/**
 * \function igraph_add_edge
 * \brief Adds a single edge to a graph.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * For directed graphs the edge points from \p from to \p to.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * Note that if you want to add many edges to a big graph, then it is
 * inefficient to add them one by one, it is better to collect them into
 * a vector and add all of them via a single \ref igraph_add_edges() call.
 * \param igraph The graph.
 * \param from The id of the first vertex of the edge.
 * \param to The id of the second vertex of the edge.
 * \return Error code.
 *
 * \sa \ref igraph_add_edges() to add many edges, \ref
 * igraph_delete_edges() to remove edges and \ref
 * igraph_add_vertices() to add vertices.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|), the number of edges plus the number of
 * vertices.
