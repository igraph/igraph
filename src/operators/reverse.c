/**
 * \function igraph_reverse_edges
 * \brief Reverses some edges of a directed graph.
 *
 * This functon reverses some edges of a directed graph. The modification is done in place.
 * All attributes, as well as the ordering of edges and vertices are preserved.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * Note that is rarely necessary to reverse \em all edges, as almost all functions that
 * handle directed graphs take a \c mode argument that can be set to \c IGRAPH_IN to
 * effectively treat edges as reversed.
 *
 * \param graph The graph whose edges will be reversed.
 * \param es    The edges to be reversed.
 *              Pass <code>igraph_ess_all(IGRAPH_EDGEORDER_ID)</code> to reverse all edges.
 * \return Error code.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(1) if all edges are reversed, otherwise
 * O(|E|) where |E| is the number of edges in the graph.
