/*************************************************************************
 *              C math library
 * function ZEROIN - obtain a function zero within the given range
 *
 * Input
 *  double zeroin(ax,bx,f,info,Tol,Maxit)
 *  double ax;          Root will be seeked for within
 *  double bx;          a range [ax,bx]
 *  double (*f)(double x, void *info); Name of the function whose zero
 *                  will be seeked for
 *  void *info;         Add'l info passed to f
 *  double *Tol;            Acceptable tolerance for the root
 *                  value.
 *                  May be specified as 0.0 to cause
 *                  the program to find the root as
 *                  accurate as possible
 *
 *  int *Maxit;         Max. iterations
 *
 *
 * Output
 *  Zeroin returns an estimate for the root with accuracy
 *  4*EPSILON*abs(x) + tol
 *  *Tol returns estimated precision
 *  *Maxit returns actual # of iterations, or -1 if maxit was
 *      reached without convergence.
 *
 * Algorithm
 *  G.Forsythe, M.Malcolm, C.Moler, Computer methods for mathematical
 *  computations. M., Mir, 1980, p.180 of the Russian edition
 *
 *  The function makes use of the bisection procedure combined with
 *  the linear or quadric inverse interpolation.
 *  At every step program operates on three abscissae - a, b, and c.
 *  b - the last and the best approximation to the root
 *  a - the last but one approximation
 *  c - the last but one or even earlier approximation than a that
 *      1) |f(b)| <= |f(c)|
 *      2) f(b) and f(c) have opposite signs, i.e. b and c confine
 *         the root
 *  At every step Zeroin selects one of the two new approximations, the
 *  former being obtained by the bisection procedure and the latter
 *  resulting in the interpolation (if a,b, and c are all different
 *  the quadric interpolation is utilized, otherwise the linear one).
 *  If the latter (i.e. obtained by the interpolation) point is
 *  reasonable (i.e. lies within the current interval [b,c] not being
 *  too close to the boundaries) it is accepted. The bisection result
 *  is used in the other case. Therefore, the range of uncertainty is
 *  ensured to be reduced at least by the factor 1.6
