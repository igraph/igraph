 * \function igraph_get_all_shortest_paths
 * \brief All shortest paths (geodesics) from a vertex.
 *
 * When there is more than one shortest path between two vertices,
 * all of them will be returned.
 *
 * \param graph The graph object.
 * \param vertices Pointer to an initialized pointer vector, the result
 *   will be stored here in \ref igraph_vector_t objects. Each vector
 *   object contains the vertices along a shortest path from \p from
 *   to another vertex. The vectors are ordered according to their
 *   target vertex: first the shortest paths to vertex 0, then to
 *   vertex 1, etc. No data is included for unreachable vertices.
 * \param edges Pointer to an initialized pointer vector, the result
 *   will be stored here in \ref igraph_vector_t objects. Each vector
 *   object contains the edges along a shortest path from \p from
 *   to another vertex. The vectors are ordered according to their
 *   target vertex: first the shortest paths to vertex 0, then to
 *   vertex 1, etc. No data is included for unreachable vertices.
 * \param nrgeo Pointer to an initialized \ref igraph_vector_t object or
 *   \c NULL. If not \c NULL the number of shortest paths from \p from are
 *   stored here for every vertex in the graph. Note that the values
 *   will be accurate only for those vertices that are in the target
 *   vertex sequence (see \p to), since the search terminates as soon
 *   as all the target vertices have been found.
 * \param from The id of the vertex from/to which the geodesics are
 *        calculated.
 * \param to Vertex sequence with the ids of the vertices to/from which the
 *        shortest paths will be calculated. A vertex might be given multiple
 *        times.
 * \param mode The type of shortest paths to be use for the
 *        calculation in directed graphs. Possible values:
 *        \clist
 *        \cli IGRAPH_OUT
 *          the lengths of the outgoing paths are calculated.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_IN
 *          the lengths of the incoming paths are calculated.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_ALL
 *          the directed graph is considered as an
 *          undirected one for the computation.
 *        \endclist
 * \return Error code:
 *        \clist
 *        \cli IGRAPH_ENOMEM
 *           not enough memory for temporary data.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_EINVVID
 *           \p from is invalid vertex id.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_EINVMODE
 *           invalid mode argument.
 *        \endclist
 *
 * Added in version 0.2.</para><para>
 *
 * Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|) for most graphs, O(|V|^2) in the worst
 * case.
