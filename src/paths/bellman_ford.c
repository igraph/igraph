/**
 * \function igraph_shortest_paths_bellman_ford
 * Weighted shortest paths from some sources allowing negative weights.
 *
 * This function is the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the weighted
 * shortest paths to all vertices from a single source. (It is run
 * independently for the given sources.). If there are no negative
 * weights, you are better off with \ref igraph_shortest_paths_dijkstra() .
 *
 * \param graph The input graph, can be directed.
 * \param res The result, a matrix. A pointer to an initialized matrix
 *    should be passed here, the matrix will be resized if needed.
 *    Each row contains the distances from a single source, to all
 *    vertices in the graph, in the order of vertex ids. For unreachable
 *    vertices the matrix contains \c IGRAPH_INFINITY.
 * \param from The source vertices.
 * \param weights The edge weights. There mustn't be any closed loop in
 *    the graph that has a negative total weight (since this would allow
 *    us to decrease the weight of any path containing at least a single
 *    vertex of this loop infinitely). Additionally, no edge weight may
 *    be NaN. If either case does not hold, an error is returned. If this
 *    is a null pointer, then the unweighted version,
 *    \ref igraph_shortest_paths() is called.
 * \param mode For directed graphs; whether to follow paths along edge
 *    directions (\c IGRAPH_OUT), or the opposite (\c IGRAPH_IN), or
 *    ignore edge directions completely (\c IGRAPH_ALL). It is ignored
 *    for undirected graphs.
 * \return Error code.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(s*|E|*|V|), where |V| is the number of
 * vertices, |E| the number of edges and s the number of sources.
 *
 * \sa \ref igraph_shortest_paths() for a faster unweighted version
 * or \ref igraph_shortest_paths_dijkstra() if you do not have negative
 * edge weights.

 * \example examples/simple/bellman_ford.c
