/*! \mainpage Outline
 *
 * This is the C++ API documentation of bliss,
 * produced by running <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">doxygen</a> in
 * the source directory.
 *
 * The algorithms and data structures used in bliss,
 * the graph file format, as well as the compilation process
 * can be found at the
 * <a href="https://users.aalto.fi/tjunttil/bliss">bliss web site</a>.
 *
 * The C++ language API is the main API to bliss.
 * It basically consists of the public methods in the classes
 * * bliss::Graph and
 * * bliss::Digraph.
 *
 * For an example of its use,
 * see the \ref executable "source of the bliss executable".
 *
 * \section capi_sec The C language API
 *
 * The C language API is given in the file bliss_C.h.
 * It is currently only a subset of the C++ API,
 * so consider using the C++ API whenever possible.
