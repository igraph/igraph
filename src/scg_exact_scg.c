 *  DESCRIPTION
 *  -----------
 *    The exact_coarse_graining function labels all the objects whose
 *    components in 'v' are equal. The result is stored in 'gr'. Labels
 *    are positive consecutive integers starting from 0.
 *    See also Section 5.4.1 (last paragraph) of the above reference.
