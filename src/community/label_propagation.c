 * \function igraph_community_label_propagation
 * \brief Community detection based on label propagation.
 *
 * This function implements the label propagation-based community detection
 * algorithm described by Raghavan, Albert and Kumara. This version extends
 * the original method by the ability to take edge weights into consideration
 * and also by allowing some labels to be fixed.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * Weights are taken into account as follows: when the new label of node
 * \c i is determined, the algorithm iterates over all edges incident on
 * node \c i and calculate the total weight of edges leading to other
 * nodes with label 0, 1, 2, ..., \c k - 1 (where \c k is the number of possible
 * labels). The new label of node \c i will then be the label whose edges
 * (among the ones incident on node \c i) have the highest total weight.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * For directed graphs, it is important to know that labels can circulate
 * freely only within the strongly connected components of the graph and
 * may propagate in only one direction (or not at all) \em between strongly
 * connected components. You should treat directed edges as directed only
 * if you are aware of the consequences.

 *
 * \param graph The input graph. Note that the algorithm wsa originally
 *    defined for undirected graphs. You are advised to set \p mode to
 *    \c IGRAPH_ALL if you pass a directed graph here to treat it as
 *    undirected.
 * \param membership The membership vector, the result is returned here.
 *    For each vertex it gives the ID of its community (label).
 * \param mode Whether to consider edge directions for the label propagation,
 *    and if so, which direction the labels should propagate. Ignored for
 *    undirected graphs. \c IGRAPH_ALL means to ignore edge directions (even
 *    in directed graphs). \c IGRAPH_OUT means to propagate labels along the
 *    natural direction of the edges. \c IGRAPH_IN means to propagate labels
 *    \em backwards (i.e. from head to tail). It is advised to set this to
 *    \c IGRAPH_ALL unless you are specifically interested in the effect of
 *    edge directions.
 * \param weights The weight vector, it should contain a positive
 *    weight for all the edges.
 * \param initial The initial state. If \c NULL, every vertex will have
 *   a different label at the beginning. Otherwise it must be a vector
 *   with an entry for each vertex. Non-negative values denote different
 *   labels, negative entries denote vertices without labels. Unlabeled
 *   vertices which are not reachable from any labeled ones will remain
 *   unlabeled at the end of the label propagation process, and will be
 *   labeled in an additional step to avoid returning negative values in
 *   \p membership. In undirected graphs, this happens when entire connected
 *   components are unlabeled. Then, each unlabeled component will receive
 *   its own separate label. In directed graphs, the outcome of the
 *   additional labeling should be considered undefined and may change
 *   in the future; please do not rely on it.
 * \param fixed Boolean vector denoting which labels are fixed. Of course
 *   this makes sense only if you provided an initial state, otherwise
 *   this element will be ignored. Note that vertices without labels
 *   cannot be fixed. The fixed status will be ignored for these with a
 *   warning. Also note that label numbers by themselves have no meaning,
 *   and igraph may renumber labels. However, co-membership constraints
 *   will be respected: two vertices can be fixed to be in the same or in
 *   different communities.
 * \param modularity If not a null pointer, then it must be a pointer
 *   to a real number. The modularity score of the detected community
 *   structure is stored here. Note that igraph will calculate the
 *   \em directed modularity if the input graph is directed, even if
 *   you set \p mode to \c IGRAPH_ALL
 * \return Error code.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(m+n)
