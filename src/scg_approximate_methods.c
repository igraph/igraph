 *  DESCRIPTION
 *  -----------
 *    The intervals_method and intervals_plus_kmeans implements the
 *    methods of sec. 5.3.2 and sec. 5.3.3 of the above reference.
 *    They take an eigenvector 'v' as parameter and a vector 'breaks'
 *    of length 'nb', which provide the intervals used to cut 'v'.
 *    Then all components of 'v' that fall into the same interval are
 *    assigned the same group label in 'gr'. The group labels are
 *    positive consecutive integers starting from 0.
 *    The intervals_method function is adapted from bincode of the R
 *    base package.
 *    The intervals_plus_kmeans is initialized with regularly-spaced
 *    breaks, which rougly corresponds to the intervals_method. Then
 *    kmeans minimizes iteratively the objective function until it gets
 *    stuck in a (usually) local minimum, or until 'itermax' is reached.
 *    So far, the breaks_computation function allows computation of
 *    constant bins, as used in intervals_method, and of equidistant
 *    centers as used in intervals_plus_kmeans.
