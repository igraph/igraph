/*
 * Internal use only.
 * Compute the cumulative proportionate values of a vector. The vector is
 * assumed to hold values associated with edges.
 *
 * \param graph The graph object representing the game network. No error
 *        checks will be performed on this graph. You are responsible for
 *        ensuring that this is a valid graph for the particular
 *        microscopic update rule at hand.
 * \param U A vector of edge values for which we want to compute cumulative
 *        proportionate values. So U[i] is the value of the edge with ID i.
 *        With a local perspective, we would only compute cumulative
 *        proportionate values for some combination of U. This vector could
 *        be, for example, a vector of weights for edges in \p graph. It is
 *        assumed that each value of U is nonnegative; it is your
 *        responsibility to ensure this. Furthermore, this vector must have a
 *        length the same as the number of edges in \p graph; you are
 *        responsible for ensuring this condition holds.
 * \param V Pointer to an uninitialized vector. The cumulative proportionate
 *        values will be computed and stored here. No error checks will be
 *        performed on this parameter.
 * \param islocal Boolean; this flag controls which perspective to use. If
 *        true then we use the local perspective; otherwise we use the global
 *        perspective. In the context of this function, the local perspective
 *        for a vertex v consists of all edges incident on v. In contrast, the
 *        global perspective for v consists of all edges in \p graph.
 * \param vid The vertex to use if we are considering a local perspective,
 *        i.e. if \p islocal is true. This vertex will be ignored if
 *        \p islocal is false. That is, if \p islocal is false then it is safe
 *        pass the value -1 here. On the other hand, if \p islocal is true then
 *        it is assumed that this is indeed a vertex of \p graph.
 * \param mode Defines the sort of neighbourhood to consider for \p vid. This
 *        is only relevant if we are considering the local perspective, i.e. if
 *        \p islocal is true. If we are considering the global perspective,
 *        then this parameter would be ignored. In other words, if \p islocal
 *        is false then it is safe to pass the value \p IGRAPH_ALL here. If
 *        \p graph is undirected, then we use all the immediate neighbours of
 *        \p vid. Thus if you know that \p graph is undirected, then it is
 *        safe to pass the value \p IGRAPH_ALL here. Supported values are:
 *        \clist
 *        \cli IGRAPH_OUT
 *          Use the out-neighbours of \p vid. This option is only relevant
 *          when \p graph is a digraph and we are considering the local
 *          perspective.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_IN
 *          Use the in-neighbours of \p vid. Again this option is only relevant
 *          when \p graph is a directed graph and we are considering the local
 *          perspective.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_ALL
 *          Use both the in- and out-neighbours of \p vid. This option is only
 *          relevant if \p graph is a digraph and we are considering a local
 *          perspective. Also use this value if \p graph is undirected or we
 *          are considering the global perspective.
 *        \endclist
 * \return Codes:
 *         \clist
 *         \cli IGRAPH_EINVAL
 *           This error code is returned in the following case: The vector
 *           \p U, or some combination of its values, sums to zero.
 *         \cli IGRAPH_SUCCESS
 *           This signal is returned if the cumulative proportionate values
 *           were successfully computed.
 *         \endclist
 *
 * Time complexity: O(2n) where n is the number of edges in the perspective
 * of \p vid.

 * A set of standard tests to be performed prior to strategy updates. The

 * tests, including sanity checks and conditions under which no strategy
 * updates are necessary.
 *
 * \param graph The graph object representing the game network. This cannot
 *        be the empty or trivial graph, but must have at least two vertices
 *        and one edge. If \p graph has one vertex, then no strategy update
 *        would take place. Furthermore, if \p graph has at least two vertices
 *        but zero edges, then strategy update would also not take place.
 * \param vid The vertex whose strategy is to be updated. It is assumed that
 *        \p vid represents a vertex in \p graph. No checking is performed and
 *        it is your responsibility to ensure that \p vid is indeed a vertex
 *        of \p graph. If an isolated vertex is provided, i.e. the input

 *        in-neighbours (respectively out-neighbours). Loops are ignored in
 *        computing the degree (in, out, all) of \p vid.
 * \param quantities A vector of quantities providing the quantity of each
 *        vertex in \p graph. Think of each entry of the vector as being
 *        generated by a function such as the fitness function for the game.
 *        So if the vector represents fitness quantities, then each vector
 *        entry is the fitness of some vertex. The length of this vector must
 *        be the same as the number of vertices in the vertex set of \p graph.
 * \param strategies A vector of the current strategies for the vertex
 *        population. Each strategy is identified with a nonnegative integer,
 *        whose interpretation depends on the payoff matrix of the game.
 *        Generally we use the strategy ID as a row or column index of the
 *        payoff matrix. The length of this vector must be the same as the
 *        number of vertices in the vertex set of \p graph.
 * \param mode Defines the sort of neighbourhood to consider for \p vid. If
 *        \p graph is undirected, then we use all the immediate neighbours of

 *        \endclist
 * \param updates Boolean; at the end of this test suite, this flag
 *        indicates whether to proceed with strategy revision. If true then
 *        strategy revision should proceed; otherwise there is no need to
 *        continue with revising a vertex's strategy. A caller function that
 *        invokes this function would use the value of \p updates to
 *        determine whether to proceed with strategy revision.
 * \param islocal Boolean; this flag controls which perspective to use. If
 *        true then we use the local perspective; otherwise we use the global
 *        perspective. The local perspective for \p vid is the set of all
 *        immediate neighbours of \p vid. In contrast, the global perspective

 * \function igraph_deterministic_optimal_imitation
 * \brief Adopt a strategy via deterministic optimal imitation.
 *
 * A simple deterministic imitation strategy where a vertex revises its
 * strategy to that which yields a local optimal. Here "local" is with
 * respect to the immediate neighbours of the vertex. The vertex retains its
 * current strategy where this strategy yields a locally optimal quantity.
 * The quantity in this case could be a measure such as fitness.
 *
 * \param graph The graph object representing the game network. This cannot
 *        be the empty or trivial graph, but must have at least two vertices
 *        and one edge. If \p graph has one vertex, then no strategy update
 *        would take place. Furthermore, if \p graph has at least two vertices
 *        but zero edges, then strategy update would also not take place.
 * \param vid The vertex whose strategy is to be updated. It is assumed that
 *        \p vid represents a vertex in \p graph. No checking is performed and
 *        it is your responsibility to ensure that \p vid is indeed a vertex
 *        of \p graph. If an isolated vertex is provided, i.e. the input
 *        vertex has degree 0, then no strategy update would take place and
 *        \p vid would retain its current strategy. Strategy update would also
 *        not take place if the local neighbourhood of \p vid are its
 *        in-neighbours (respectively out-neighbours), but \p vid has zero
 *        in-neighbours (respectively out-neighbours). Loops are ignored in
 *        computing the degree (in, out, all) of \p vid.
 * \param optimality Logical; controls the type of optimality to be used.
 *        Supported values are:
 *        \clist
 *        \cli IGRAPH_MAXIMUM
 *          Use maximum deterministic imitation, where the strategy of the
 *          vertex with maximum quantity (e.g. fitness) would be adopted. We
 *          update the strategy of \p vid to that which yields a local
 *          maximum.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_MINIMUM
 *          Use minimum deterministic imitation. That is, the strategy of the
 *          vertex with minimum quantity would be imitated. In other words,
 *          update to the strategy that yields a local minimum.
 *        \endclist
 * \param quantities A vector of quantities providing the quantity of each
 *        vertex in \p graph. Think of each entry of the vector as being
 *        generated by a function such as the fitness function for the game.
 *        So if the vector represents fitness quantities, then each vector
 *        entry is the fitness of some vertex. The length of this vector must
 *        be the same as the number of vertices in the vertex set of \p graph.
 * \param strategies A vector of the current strategies for the vertex
 *        population. The updated strategy for \p vid would be stored here.
 *        Each strategy is identified with a nonnegative integer, whose
 *        interpretation depends on the payoff matrix of the game. Generally
 *        we use the strategy ID as a row or column index of the payoff
 *        matrix. The length of this vector must be the same as the number of
 *        vertices in the vertex set of \p graph.
 * \param mode Defines the sort of neighbourhood to consider for \p vid. If
 *        \p graph is undirected, then we use all the immediate neighbours of
 *        \p vid. Thus if you know that \p graph is undirected, then it is safe
 *        to pass the value \p IGRAPH_ALL here. Supported values are:
 *        \clist
 *        \cli IGRAPH_OUT
 *          Use the out-neighbours of \p vid. This option is only relevant
 *          when \p graph is a directed graph.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_IN
 *          Use the in-neighbours of \p vid. Again this option is only relevant
 *          when \p graph is a directed graph.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_ALL
 *          Use both the in- and out-neighbours of \p vid. This option is only
 *          relevant if \p graph is a digraph. Also use this value if
 *          \p graph is undirected.
 *        \endclist
 * \return The error code \p IGRAPH_EINVAL is returned in each of the
 *         following cases: (1) Any of the parameters \p graph, \p quantities,
 *         or \p strategies is a null pointer. (2) The vector \p quantities
 *         or \p strategies has a length different from the number of vertices
 *         in \p graph. (3) The parameter \p graph is the empty or null graph,
 *         i.e. the graph with zero vertices and edges.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(2d), where d is the degree of the vertex \p vid.

 * \function igraph_moran_process
 * \brief The Moran process in a network setting.
 *
 * This is an extension of the classic Moran process to a network setting.
 * The Moran process is a model of haploid (asexual) reproduction within a
 * population having a fixed size. In the network setting, the Moran process
 * operates on a weighted graph. At each time step a vertex a is chosen for
 * reproduction and another vertex b is chosen for death. Vertex a gives birth
 * to an identical clone c, which replaces b. Vertex c is a clone of a in that
 * c inherits both the current quantity (e.g. fitness) and current strategy
 * of a.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * The graph G representing the game network is assumed to be simple,
 * i.e. free of loops and without multiple edges. If, on the other hand, G has
 * a loop incident on some vertex v, then it is possible that when v is chosen
 * for reproduction it would forgo this opportunity. In particular, when v is
 * chosen for reproduction and v is also chosen for death, the clone of v
 * would be v itself with its current vertex ID. In effect v forgoes its
 * chance for reproduction.
 *
 * \param graph The graph object representing the game network. This cannot
 *        be the empty or trivial graph, but must have at least two vertices

 *        following cases: (1) If \p graph has one vertex. (2) If \p graph has
 *        at least two vertices but zero edges.
 * \param weights A vector of all edge weights for \p graph. Thus weights[i]
 *        means the weight of the edge with edge ID i. For the purpose of the
 *        Moran process, each weight is assumed to be positive; it is your
 *        responsibility to ensure this condition holds. The length of this
 *        vector must be the same as the number of edges in \p graph.
 * \param quantities A vector of quantities providing the quantity of each
 *        vertex in \p graph. The quantity of the new clone will be stored
 *        here. Think of each entry of the vector as being generated by a
 *        function such as the fitness function for the game. So if the vector
 *        represents fitness quantities, then each vector entry is the fitness
 *        of some vertex. The length of this vector must be the same as the
 *        number of vertices in the vertex set of \p graph. For the purpose of
 *        the Moran process, each vector entry is assumed to be nonnegative;
 *        no checks will be performed for this. It is your responsibility to
 *        ensure that at least one entry is positive. Furthermore, this vector
 *        cannot be a vector of zeros; this condition will be checked.
 * \param strategies A vector of the current strategies for the vertex
 *        population. The strategy of the new clone will be stored here. Each
 *        strategy is identified with a nonnegative integer, whose
 *        interpretation depends on the payoff matrix of the game. Generally

 *          Use the out-neighbours of a. This option is only relevant when
 *          \p graph is directed.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_IN
 *          Use the in-neighbours of a. Again this option is only relevant
 *          when \p graph is directed.

 *        computing the relative quantity. If true then we use the local
 *        perspective; otherwise we use the global perspective. The local
 *        perspective for \p vid is the set of all immediate neighbours of
 *        \p vid. In contrast, the global perspective for \p vid is the
 *        vertex set of \p graph.
 * \param quantities A vector of quantities providing the quantity of each
 *        vertex in \p graph. Think of each entry of the vector as being
 *        generated by a function such as the fitness function for the game.
 *        So if the vector represents fitness quantities, then each vector
 *        entry is the fitness of some vertex. The length of this vector must
 *        be the same as the number of vertices in the vertex set of \p graph.
 *        For the purpose of roulette wheel selection, each vector entry is
 *        assumed to be nonnegative; no checks will be performed for this. It
 *        is your responsibility to ensure that at least one entry is nonzero.
 *        Furthermore, this vector cannot be a vector of zeros; this condition
 *        will be checked.
 * \param strategies A vector of the current strategies for the vertex
 *        population. The updated strategy for \p vid would be stored here.
 *        Each strategy is identified with a nonnegative integer, whose
 *        interpretation depends on the payoff matrix of the game. Generally
 *        we use the strategy ID as a row or column index of the payoff
 *        matrix. The length of this vector must be the same as the number of
 *        vertices in the vertex set of \p graph.
 * \param mode Defines the sort of neighbourhood to consider for \p vid. This
 *        is only relevant if we are considering the local perspective, i.e. if
 *        \p islocal is true. If we are considering the global perspective,
 *        then it is safe to pass the value \p IGRAPH_ALL here. If \p graph is
 *        undirected, then we use all the immediate neighbours of \p vid. Thus
 *        if you know that \p graph is undirected, then it is safe to pass the
 *        value \p IGRAPH_ALL here. Supported values are:
 *        \clist
 *        \cli IGRAPH_OUT
 *          Use the out-neighbours of \p vid. This option is only relevant
 *          when \p graph is a digraph and we are considering the local
 *          perspective.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_IN
 *          Use the in-neighbours of \p vid. Again this option is only relevant
 *          when \p graph is a directed graph and we are considering the local
 *          perspective.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_ALL
 *          Use both the in- and out-neighbours of \p vid. This option is only
 *          relevant if \p graph is a digraph. Also use this value if
 *          \p graph is undirected or we are considering the global
 *          perspective.
 *        \endclist
 * \return The error code \p IGRAPH_EINVAL is returned in each of the following
 *         cases: (1) Any of the parameters \p graph, \p quantities, or
 *         \p strategies is a null pointer. (2) The vector \p quantities or
 *         \p strategies has a length different from the number of vertices
 *         in \p graph. (3) The parameter \p graph is the empty or null graph,
 *         i.e. the graph with zero vertices and edges. (4) The vector
 *         \p quantities sums to zero.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of vertices in the perspective
 * to consider. If we consider the global perspective, then n is the number
 * of vertices in the vertex set of \p graph. On the other hand, for the local
 * perspective n is the degree of \p vid, excluding loops.

 * \function igraph_stochastic_imitation
 * \brief Adopt a strategy via stochastic imitation with uniform selection.
 *
 * A simple stochastic imitation strategy where a vertex revises its
 * strategy to that of a vertex chosen uniformly at random from its local
 * neighbourhood. This is called stochastic imitation via uniform selection,
 * where the strategy to imitate is chosen via some random process. For the
 * purposes of this function, we use uniform selection from a pool of
 * candidates.
 *
 * \param graph The graph object representing the game network. This cannot
 *        be the empty or trivial graph, but must have at least two vertices
 *        and one edge. If \p graph has one vertex, then no strategy update
 *        would take place. Furthermore, if \p graph has at least two vertices
 *        but zero edges, then strategy update would also not take place.
 * \param vid The vertex whose strategy is to be updated. It is assumed that
 *        \p vid represents a vertex in \p graph. No checking is performed and
 *        it is your responsibility to ensure that \p vid is indeed a vertex
 *        of \p graph. If an isolated vertex is provided, i.e. the input
 *        vertex has degree 0, then no strategy update would take place and
 *        \p vid would retain its current strategy. Strategy update would also
 *        not take place if the local neighbourhood of \p vid are its
 *        in-neighbours (respectively out-neighbours), but \p vid has zero
 *        in-neighbours (respectively out-neighbours). Loops are ignored in
 *        computing the degree (in, out, all) of \p vid.
 * \param algo This flag controls which algorithm to use in stochastic
 *        imitation. Supported values are:
 *        \clist
 *        \cli IGRAPH_IMITATE_AUGMENTED
 *          Augmented imitation. Vertex \p vid imitates the strategy of the
 *          chosen vertex u provided that doing so would increase the
 *          quantity (e.g. fitness) of \p vid. Augmented imitation can be
 *          thought of as "imitate if better".
 *        \cli IGRAPH_IMITATE_BLIND
 *          Blind imitation. Vertex \p vid blindly imitates the strategy of
 *          the chosen vertex u, regardless of whether doing so would
 *          increase or decrease the quantity of \p vid.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_IMITATE_CONTRACTED
 *          Contracted imitation. Here vertex \p vid imitates the strategy of
 *          the chosen vertex u if doing so would decrease the quantity of
 *          \p vid. Think of contracted imitation as "imitate if worse".
 *        \endclist
 * \param quantities A vector of quantities providing the quantity of each
 *        vertex in \p graph. Think of each entry of the vector as being
 *        generated by a function such as the fitness function for the game.
 *        So if the vector represents fitness quantities, then each vector
 *        entry is the fitness of some vertex. The length of this vector must
 *        be the same as the number of vertices in the vertex set of \p graph.
 * \param strategies A vector of the current strategies for the vertex
 *        population. The updated strategy for \p vid would be stored here.
 *        Each strategy is identified with a nonnegative integer, whose
 *        interpretation depends on the payoff matrix of the game. Generally
 *        we use the strategy ID as a row or column index of the payoff
 *        matrix. The length of this vector must be the same as the number of
 *        vertices in the vertex set of \p graph.
 * \param mode Defines the sort of neighbourhood to consider for \p vid. If
 *        \p graph is undirected, then we use all the immediate neighbours of
 *        \p vid. Thus if you know that \p graph is undirected, then it is safe
 *        to pass the value \p IGRAPH_ALL here. Supported values are:
 *        \clist
 *        \cli IGRAPH_OUT
 *          Use the out-neighbours of \p vid. This option is only relevant
 *          when \p graph is a directed graph.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_IN
 *          Use the in-neighbours of \p vid. Again this option is only relevant
 *          when \p graph is a directed graph.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_ALL
 *          Use both the in- and out-neighbours of \p vid. This option is only
 *          relevant if \p graph is a digraph. Also use this value if
 *          \p graph is undirected.
 *        \endclist
 * \return The error code \p IGRAPH_EINVAL is returned in each of the following
 *         cases: (1) Any of the parameters \p graph, \p quantities, or
 *         \p strategies is a null pointer. (2) The vector \p quantities or
 *         \p strategies has a length different from the number of vertices
 *         in \p graph. (3) The parameter \p graph is the empty or null graph,
 *         i.e. the graph with zero vertices and edges. (4) The parameter
 *         \p algo refers to an unsupported stochastic imitation algorithm.
 *
 * Time complexity: depends on the uniform random number generator, but should
 * usually be O(1).
