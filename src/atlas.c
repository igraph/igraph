 * The number of the graph is given as a parameter.
 * The graphs are listed: \olist

 *      \oli for a fixed number of nodes, in increasing order of the
 *           number of edges;
 *      \oli for fixed numbers of nodes and edges, in increasing
 *           order of the degree sequence, for example 111223 &lt; 112222;
 *      \oli for fixed degree sequence, in increasing number of
 *           automorphisms.

 * \param graph Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.
 * \param number The number of the graph to generate.
