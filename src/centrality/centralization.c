 * \function igraph_centralization
 * \brief Calculate the centralization score from the node level scores.
 *
 * For a centrality score defined on the vertices of a graph, it is
 * possible to define a graph level centralization index, by
 * calculating the sum of the deviation from the maximum centrality
 * score. Consequently, the higher the centralization index of the
 * graph, the more centralized the structure is.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * In order to make graphs of different sizes comparable,
 * the centralization index is usually normalized to a number between
 * zero and one, by dividing the (unnormalized) centralization score
 * of the most centralized structure with the same number of vertices.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * For most centrality indices the most centralized
 * structure is the star graph, a single center connected to all other
 * nodes in the network. There are some variation depending on whether
 * the graph is directed or not, whether loop edges are allowed, etc.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * This function simply calculates the graph level index, if the node
 * level scores and the theoretical maximum are given. It is called by
 * all the measure-specific centralization functions.
 *
 * \param scores A vector containing the node-level centrality scores.
 * \param theoretical_max The graph level centrality score of the most
 *     centralized graph with the same number of vertices. Only used
 *     if \c normalized set to true.
 * \param normalized Boolean, whether to normalize the centralization
 *     by dividing the supplied theoretical maximum.
 * \return The graph level index.

 * igraph_centralization_betweenness(), \ref
 * igraph_centralization_closeness(), and \ref
