 * We provide separate implementations of single-source shortest path searches,
 * one with incidence lists and one with adjacency lists. We use the implementation
 * based on adjacency lists when possible (i.e. when weights are not needed) to
 * avoid an expensive IGRAPH_OTHER() lookup on edge IDs. The cost of this macro
 * comes from the inability of the branch predictor to predict accurately whether
 * the condition in the macro will be true or not.
 * 
 * The following four functions are very similar in their structure. If you make
 * a modification to one of them, consider whether the same modification makes
 * sense in the context of the remaining three functions as well.

 * \function igraph_betweenness
 * \brief Betweenness centrality of some vertices.
 *
 * The betweenness centrality of a vertex is the number of geodesics
 * going through it. If there are more than one geodesic between two
 * vertices, the value of these geodesics are weighted by one over the
 * number of geodesics.
 * \param graph The graph object.
 * \param res The result of the computation, a vector containing the
 *        betweenness scores for the specified vertices.
 * \param vids The vertices of which the betweenness centrality scores
 *        will be calculated.
 * \param directed Logical, if true directed paths will be considered
 *        for directed graphs. It is ignored for undirected graphs.
 * \param weights An optional vector containing edge weights for
 *        calculating weighted betweenness. No edge weight may be NaN.
 *        Supply a null pointer here for unweighted betweenness.
 * \return Error code:
 *        \c IGRAPH_ENOMEM, not enough memory for
 *        temporary data.
 *        \c IGRAPH_EINVVID, invalid vertex id passed in
 *        \p vids.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(|V||E|),
 * |V| and
 * |E| are the number of vertices and
 * edges in the graph.
 * Note that the time complexity is independent of the number of
 * vertices for which the score is calculated.
 *
 * \sa Other centrality types: \ref igraph_degree(), \ref igraph_closeness().

 * This function computes the subset-limited version of edge betweenness centrality
 * by considering only those shortest paths that lie between vertices in a given
 * source and target subset.
 *
 * \param graph The graph object.
 * \param res The result of the computation, vector containing the
 *        betweenness scores for the edges.
 * \param eids The edges for which the subset-limited betweenness centrality
 *        scores will be computed.
 * \param directed Logical, if true directed paths will be considered
 *        for directed graphs. It is ignored for undirected graphs.
 * \param weights An optional weight vector for weighted
 *        betweenness. No edge weight may be NaN. Supply a null
 *        pointer here for unweighted betweenness.
 * \param sources A vertex selector for the sources of the shortest paths taken
 *        into considuration in the betweenness calculation.
 * \param targets A vertex selector for the targets of the shortest paths taken
 *        into considuration in the betweenness calculation.
 * \return Error code:
 *        \c IGRAPH_ENOMEM, not enough memory for temporary data.
 *        \c IGRAPH_EINVVID, invalid vertex ID passed in \p sources or \p targets
 *
 * Time complexity: O(|S||E|),
 * |S| The number of vertices in the subset
 * |E| The number of edges in the graph
