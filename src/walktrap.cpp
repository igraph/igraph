/**
 * \function igraph_community_walktrap
 *
 * This function is the implementation of the Walktrap community
 * finding algorithm, see Pascal Pons, Matthieu Latapy: Computing
 * communities in large networks using random walks,
 * https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0512106
 *
 * </para><para>
 * Currently the original C++ implementation is used in igraph,
 * see https://www-complexnetworks.lip6.fr/~latapy/PP/walktrap.html
 * We are grateful to Matthieu Latapy and Pascal Pons for providing this
 * source code.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * In contrast to the original implementation, isolated vertices are allowed
 * in the graph and they are assumed to have a single incident loop edge with
 * weight 1.
 *
 * \param graph The input graph, edge directions are ignored.
 * \param weights Numeric vector giving the weights of the edges.
 *     If it is a NULL pointer then all edges will have equal
 *     weights. The weights are expected to be positive.
 * \param steps Integer constant, the length of the random walks.
 * \param merges Pointer to a matrix, the merges performed by the
 *     algorithm will be stored here (if not NULL). Each merge is a
 *     row in a two-column matrix and contains the ids of the merged
 *     clusters. Clusters are numbered from zero and cluster numbers
 *     smaller than the number of nodes in the network belong to the
 *     individual vertices as singleton clusters. In each step a new
 *     cluster is created from two other clusters and its id will be
 *     one larger than the largest cluster id so far. This means that
 *     before the first merge we have \c n clusters (the number of
 *     vertices in the graph) numbered from zero to \c n-1. The first
 *     merge creates cluster \c n, the second cluster \c n+1, etc.
 * \param modularity Pointer to a vector. If not NULL then the
 *     modularity score of the current clustering is stored here after
 *     each merge operation.
 * \param membership Pointer to a vector. If not a NULL pointer, then
 *     the membership vector corresponding to the maximal modularity
 *     score is stored here. If it is not a NULL pointer, then neither
 *     \p modularity nor \p merges may be NULL.
 * \return Error code.
 *
 * \sa \ref igraph_community_spinglass(), \ref
 * igraph_community_edge_betweenness().
 *
 * Time complexity: O(|E||V|^2) in the worst case, O(|V|^2 log|V|) typically,
 * |V| is the number of vertices, |E| is the number of edges.
