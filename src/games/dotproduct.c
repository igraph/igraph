/**
 * \function igraph_dot_product_game
 * \brief Generates a random dot product graph.
 *
 * In this model, each vertex is represented by a latent
 * position vector. Probability of an edge between two vertices are given
 * by the dot product of their latent position vectors.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * See also Christine Leigh Myers Nickel: Random dot product graphs, a
 * model for social networks. Dissertation, Johns Hopkins University,
 * Maryland, USA, 2006.
 *
 * \param graph The output graph is stored here.
 * \param vecs A matrix in which each latent position vector is a
 *    column. The dot product of the latent position vectors should be
 *    in the [0,1] interval, otherwise a warning is given. For
 *    negative dot products, no edges are added; dot products that are
 *    larger than one always add an edge.
 * \param directed Should the generated graph be directed?
 * \return Error code.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n*n*m), where n is the number of vertices,
 * and m is the length of the latent vectors.
 *
 * \sa \ref igraph_rng_sample_dirichlet(), \ref
 * igraph_rng_sample_sphere_volume(), \ref igraph_rng_sample_sphere_surface()
 * for functions to generate the latent vectors.
