 * \c v[i] after the function is executed.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * It is an error to call this function with an index vector that does not
 * represent a valid permutation. Each element in the index vector must be
 * between 0 and the length of the list minus one (inclusive), and each such
 * element must appear only once. The function does not attempt to validate the
 * index vector. Memory may be leaked if the index vector does not satisfy these
 * conditions.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * The index vector that this function takes is compatible with the index vector
 * returned from \ref igraph_vector_list_sort_ind(); passing in the index vector
 * from \ref igraph_vector_list_sort_ind() will sort the original vector.
 *
 * \param v     the list to permute
 * \param index the index vector
