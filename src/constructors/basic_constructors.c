/**
 * \function igraph_small
 * \brief Shorthand to create a small graph, giving the edges as arguments.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * This function is handy when a relatively small graph needs to be created.
 * Instead of giving the edges as a vector, they are given simply as
 * arguments and a <code>-1</code> needs to be given after the last meaningful
 * edge argument.
 *
 * </para><para>Note that only graphs which have vertex IDs smaller than
 * the largest value representable by the <type>int</type> type can be created this way.
 * If you give larger values then the result is undefined.
 *
 * \param graph Pointer to an uninitialized graph object. The result
 *        will be stored here.
 * \param n The number of vertices in the graph; a non-negative integer.
 * \param directed Logical constant; gives whether the graph should be
 *        directed. Supported values are:
 *        \clist
 *        \cli IGRAPH_DIRECTED
 *          The graph to be created will be \em directed.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_UNDIRECTED
 *          The graph to be created will be \em undirected.
 *        \endclist
 * \param ... The additional arguments giving the edges of the
 *        graph. Don't forget to supply an additional <code>-1</code> after the last
 *        (meaningful) argument. The \p first parameter is present for
 *        technical reasons and represents the first variadic argument.
 * \return Error code.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|), the number of vertices plus the number
 * of edges in the graph to create.
 *
 * \example examples/simple/igraph_small.c
