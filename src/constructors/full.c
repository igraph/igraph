 * \function igraph_full
 * \brief Creates a full graph (directed or undirected, with or without loops).
 *
 * </para><para>
 * In a full graph every possible edge is present, every vertex is
 * connected to every other vertex. A full graph in \c igraph should be
 * distinguished from the concept of complete graphs as used in graph theory.
 * If n is a positive integer, then the complete graph K_n on n vertices is
 * the undirected simple graph with the following property. For any distinct
 * pair (u,v) of vertices in K_n, uv (or equivalently vu) is an edge of K_n.
 * In \c igraph, a full graph on n vertices can be K_n, a directed version of
 * K_n, or K_n with at least one loop edge. In any case, if F is a full graph
 * on n vertices as generated by \c igraph, then K_n is a subgraph of the
 * undirected version of F.
 *
 * \param graph Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.
 * \param n Integer, the number of vertices in the graph.
 * \param directed Logical, whether to create a directed graph.
 * \param loops Logical, whether to include self-edges (loops).
 * \return Error code:
 *         \c IGRAPH_EINVAL: invalid number of vertices.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|),
 * |V| is the number of vertices,
 * |E| the number of edges in the
 * graph. Of course this is the same as
 * O(|E|)=O(|V||V|)
 * here.
 *
 * \sa \ref igraph_square_lattice(), \ref igraph_star(), \ref igraph_kary_tree()
 * for creating other regular structures.
