 * \function igraph_atlas
 * \brief Create a small graph from the \quote Graph Atlas \endquote.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * The graph atlas contains all simple undirected unlabeled graphs on between
 * 0 and 7 vertices. The number of the graph is given as a parameter.
 * The graphs are listed:
 *      \olist
 *      \oli in increasing order of number of vertices;
 *      \oli for a fixed number of vertices, in increasing order of the
 *           number of edges;
 *      \oli for fixed numbers of vertices and edges, in laxicographically
 *           increasing order of the degree sequence, for example
 *           111223 &lt; 112222;
 *      \oli for fixed degree sequence, in increasing number of
 *           automorphisms.
 *      \endolist
 *
 * </para><para>
 * The data was converted from the NetworkX software package,
 * see https://networkx.org/.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * See \emb An Atlas of Graphs \eme by Ronald C. Read and Robin J. Wilson,
 * Oxford University Press, 1998.
 *
 * \param graph Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.
 * \param number The number of the graph to generate. Must be between 0 and
 *    1252 (inclusive). Graphs on 0-7 vertices start at numbers 0, 1, 2, 4,
 *    8, 19, 53, and 209, respectively.
 *
 * Added in version 0.2.</para><para>
 *
 * Time complexity: O(|V|+|E|), the number of vertices plus the number of
 * edges.
