/**
 * \function igraph_tree_from_parent_vector
 * \brief Constructs a tree or forest from a vector encoding the parent of each vertex.
 *
 * \experimental
 *
 * Rooted trees and forests are conveniently represented using a \p parents
 * vector where the ID of the parent of vertex \c v is stored in <code>parents[v]</code>.
 * This function serves to construct an igraph graph from a parent vector representation.
 * The result is guaranteed to be a forest or a tree. If the \p parents vector
 * is found to encode a cycle or a self-loop, an error is raised.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * Several igraph functions produce such vectors, such as graph traversal
 * functions (\ref igraph_bfs() and \ref igraph_dfs()), shortest path functions
 * that construct a shortest path tree, as well as some other specialized
 * functions like \ref igraph_dominator_tree() or \ref igraph_cohesive_blocks().
 * Vertices which do not have parents (i.e. roots) get a negative entry in the
 * \p parents vector.
 *
 * </para><para>
 * Use \ref igraph_bfs() or \ref igraph_dfs() to convert a forest into a parent
 * vector representation. For trees, i.e. forests with a single root, it is
 * more convenient to use \ref igraph_bfs_simple().
 *
 * \param graph Pointer to an uninitialized graph object.
 * \param parents The parent vector. <code>parents[v]</code> is the ID of
 *    the parent vertex of \c v. <code>parents[v] < 0</code> indicates that
 *    \c v does not have a parent.
 * \param type Constant, gives whether to create a directed tree, and
 *        if this is the case, also its orientation. Possible values:
 *        \clist
 *        \cli IGRAPH_TREE_OUT
 *          directed tree, the edges point from the parents to their children.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_TREE_IN
 *          directed tree, the edges point from the children to their parents.
 *        \cli IGRAPH_TREE_UNDIRECTED undirected tree.
 *        \endclist
 * \return Error code.
 *
 * \sa \ref igraph_bfs(), \ref igraph_bfs_simple() for back-conversion;
 * \ref igraph_from_prufer() for creating trees from PrÃ¼fer sequences;
 * \ref igraph_is_tree() and \ref igraph_is_forest() to check if a graph
 * is a tree or forest.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of \p parents.
